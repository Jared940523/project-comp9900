We thus will talk about the experimental method in economics (and how it differs from methods in other social sciences) and will do so both by reading widely cited articles and by doing selected experiments. We shall discuss the advantages and disadvantages of experimental methods relative to other empirical social science methods such as econometrics, and will document how it can be used to explore the robustness of the ""homo economicus"" assumption of a rational, selfish decision maker used in many economic models. We will find that economic theory does a good job in many applications but that there are also important behavioural deviations from the model of “homo economicus”.

It differs from asset pricing theory in which prices are assumed to be set such that supply and demand are equated via some costless auction-type frictionless mechanism that remains an undisclosed ‘black box’. Actual markets require actual rules and these rules affect the way in which prices are established, the way in which information possessed by traders is incorporated into asset prices, why some markets and stocks are liquid and why some markets are more fragile and costly than others. A few years ago, brokers were collectively able to set high minimum fees, exceedingly high minimum spreads (transaction costs reflecting the minimum tick size), monopoly provision of limit-order placement by the ‘specialist’, prohibition on the entry of alternative exchange mechanisms and numerous other anti-competitive practices designed to protect stockbroker incomes. ,Major markets such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) remained unable to open for hours during crisis periods such as occurred in 1987. In part due to the huge growth in both market microstructure theory and empirical work in recent years, stock markets have become far more competitive in recent years but many remain opaque and it is far from clear that pricing efficiency has improved. This course provides the necessary theoretical insights to comprehend the nature of these radical changes and to understand the direction that both competition and design rule changes are taking global exchange activities for stocks and other financial instruments.,All wealth creation requires an understanding of how asset prices are actually set, how investors can draw on their assets (wealth) when needed, i.e., their liquidity, and at what cost. Should investors delegate choice of their portfolios for their retirement to others or should they become active traders themselves? If so, how and where should they trade?

This course is strictly for students undertaking Law programs only.,(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Undergraduate,LAWS1150,6,"This course introduces students to the basic elements and principles of private law. It begins by looking at what the term private law means, the sources of private law and how the different areas of private law - especially property, contract, tort and unjust enrichment – relate to each other.,The bulk of the course is spent on the topics of contract and property law. In both cases, the course provides an introduction to materials that are expanded upon in later subjects. With respect to contract law, this course covers the formation of contracts and the doctrine of privity. Several other elements of contract law are dealt with later in the curriculum in Contracts. With respect to property law, this course considers the boundaries of the concept of property, as well as several of the rules with respect to the creation, transfer and protection of property rights. Again several other elements of property law are dealt with later in Land Law, and to some extent also in Equity and Trusts.,The course also introduces students to two smaller topics: agency and equitable estoppel. As well as being closely related to contracts and property, these are two important areas of law for practicing lawyers.,The final component of the course returns to the theoretical foundations of private law.

These concepts can be extended to quite general situations. The simplest of these is when there is some way of measuring the distance between two objects. Some of the most important examples of these `metric spaces' occur as sets of functions, so this course looks at ways in which one might say that a sequence of functions converges. Taking these ideas one step further, we look at convergence which does not come from a generalised distance function. These are the ideas of point set topology. ,The course includes topics such as countability, continuity, uniform convergence and compactness, as well as an introduction to the core areas of function analysis.

The Data Analysis strand uses data from simple experimental and observational studies, and introduces graphical methods for data presentation and exploration. It discusses the important concepts of populations, samples and randomness, and explains how to relate sample values to population values and test claims about population parameters. Association between different measurements is quantified, and methods of modelling the relationship between two variables are studied. The Multivariable Calculus strand describes surfaces in three dimensions using contour plots, partial derivatives and the gradient vector.  Of great importance is the location of maxima or minima of the function, leading to a discussion of the methods of optimisation for functions of several variables, especially when auxiliary constraints must also be satisfied.

Plato, one of the West’s most famous and influential philosophers, spent a good deal of thought on what constitutes the ideal city, who would be its legitimate and illegitimate inhabitants and who would govern it.,In modern times the goal of influencing behaviour through city planning is clearly evident. Modernists such as Baron von Hausmann and Le Corbusier and, closer to home, Walter Burley Griffin, recognised the role that space played in shaping the behaviour of individuals and in shaping the direction of society. Yet although space can be planned to some degree to direct people to act, speak and even think in certain ways, there are of course many other facets of human action that thwart the best laid plans. The unpredictability of human action ensures a constantly changing landscape, which can only be explained by understanding the interplay between people and space.,The material examined is topical in nature and includes Australian and international examples, with a focus on urban environments.

Social stratification and its variations, derived mostly from cultural and religious norms, contribute to the way Indonesia’s politics and democracy is perceived and practiced both by the state and the population.

Prerequisite: ZEIT3600,(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,UNSW,Undergraduate,ZEIT4603,6,"These days the analysis of all but the simple structures is carried out with the aid of computer programs based on the finite element method (FE). The user of the FE method has to decide what kind of elements should be used, and how many of them? Where should the mesh be fine and where may it be coarse? Can the model be simplified? How accurate will the answers be, and how can they be checked? One need not understand all the mathematics of the finite element to answer these questions. However a competent user must have an understanding of the preliminary mathematics and must be able to understand how elements behave in order to choose suitable kinds, sizes and shapes of elements, and to guard against misinterpretations and unrealistically high expectations. This course is a balanced theoretical and practical introduction to the use of the FE method. The first chapter deals with matrix structural analysis, which is the ancestor of the finite element method. The second chapter deals with finite element approximation and numerical integration. The third chapter is an application of the finite element method to linear plane elasticity problems. The fourth chapter deals with the analysis of thin and thick plates, which are commonly used in civil engineering as floor slabs.

L2 SPI Prerequisite,(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Paddington,Undergraduate,SART3410,6,"This course, SPI: Relational Art, focuses on the genre described by Nicolas Bourriaud in 1998 to describe art practices that are positioned in  social contexts rather than exhibited in specialist art venues, that may have a functional purpose, that place the viewer or community at the centre as agent rather than the autonomous artist. This course provides you with the opportunity to explore this inter disciplinary, interactive way of working with social issues and community in mind. You will begin with the initial  stimulation of a concept based project, considering the ramifications of locating artworks in the context of a pristine natural environment at Sculpture Camp, or a peri-urban zone, that is, a location where urban development infringes on nature, or vice versa. This is followed by a thematic project that addresses the functional objectives of Relational Art. The course concludes with a largely self directed project that addresses an appropriate topic, which may be an elaboration upon one of the first two projects,  with the approval of your lecturer, if the ambition and complexity requires extra time to complete. ,Assessment in this course includes the presentation of (up to) three completed projects depending on their ambition and complexity, that address social contexts or issues. You will write  an accompanying report on your research objectives, the research underlying the artworks, and an analysis of  the creative outcomes. This specialist course investigates professional studio practice, the deployment of appropriate methodologies, such as learning skill sets appropriate to your creative tasks,  and requires a self motivated committment to your practice in  the Sculpture Performance & Installation Stream. In particular, you will learn to address issues usually outside the provence of gallery based art, with consideration of engaging interactive participants rather than passive viewers. This course relates to companion courses in the Sculpture Performance & Installation Stream by providing opportunities to extend your practice to include interactive art  in association with other Sculpture Performance & Installation (SPI) courses in Year 3.",Faculty of Art & Design,/faculties/2018/cofa/artdesign.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/SART3410.html,3,Downloadcourse outline (PDF format),http://www.handbook.cofa.unsw.edu.au/scripts/getoutline.php,School of Art & Design,http://www.artdesign.unsw.edu.au,SPI: Relational Art,http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/SART3410.html

The  course encompasses the following main areas: micro/macroeconomic processes that drive urban land use, governance and planning systems; market failures as the source of urban planning problems; development feasibility and the economic theories of urbanisation, gentrification and globalisation. In particular micro-economic and macro-economic processes underpin urban land-use patterns, property values, activity and transport systems. The processes of economic growth and decline are a perennial consideration of planning at different scales. Therefore the course focuses on development and planning across metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions. Students gain an understanding of how planning objectives are influenced by the aggregate impacts of uneven economic growth processes and economic behaviour.

Since the course is core to the Musicology Stream, inquiry itself is the primary focus. The course therefore begins with questions: how do musicologists conceive of the music they listen to? how are those conceptions communicated to others? how do ideas about music change historically? what methods have been developed to hone musical ideas? The aim of musicology is always to persuade others of how you hear music, whether your approach to music is through biographical study, manuscript study (paleography, editions, publication history and considerations, marked scores), primary source study, analysis, organology, iconography, criticism, aesthetics, hermeneutics, reception history, performance studies, transcription, music psychology, or ethnography.

Universal though these truths might appear to be, the various musical expressions of the world’s peoples are as diverse, unique, and sometimes strange, as the natural and cultural worlds that make them. Today we can access that musical diversity easily. We can buy it, download it, iPod it. But just how much do we know about the peoples, histories, sentiments, and lives of the musicians and singers that produce this music? How much do we grasp the beauty, the yearning, and the spirituality in that music? What can we learn that will deepen our appreciation, understanding, and perhaps performance of the many musical expressions available to us today?,This World Music course surveys and examines the relationships between music, the society in which it is performed, and individual selves. It explores both traditional and contemporary music of Aboriginal Australia, South-east Asia, India, Central Asia and the Middle East, West Africa and the Caribbean, and marginal Europe. It examines how musical practices express, shape, and allow for the individual and collective construction and negotiation of identity, ethnicity, gender, spirituality and class.

This course provides students with a holistic understanding of the big picture, wide spectrum, and structured process of engineering design. In particular, it focuses on the early stage design, with respect to functional design and conceptual design, which greatly determines the ultimate success of any new product development.,Unlike the purely technical engineering subjects, engineering design is characterized by the synergy between “analysis” and “synthesis”, between “rationality” and “optimality”, as well as between “do the right thing” and “do the thing right”. Therefore, this course aims to make you understand the socio-technical nature of engineering design, and provide you with the capacity of not only solving a given design problem using relevant engineering knowledge, but also formulating a new design problem. ,Design thinking is a fundamental skill that every engineer must have for the 21st Century. It is one of the skills that profoundly distinguish human intelligence from artificial intelligence, which greatly impacts an engineer’s long-term career success in the workplace.

All students will enrol in MFAC 3501-3509 and may enrol in additional courses, depending on whether they have undertaken earlier individualised study programs or have been granted any exemptions.,Objectives: - By completion of Phase 3, students will be expected to demonstrate an integrated achievement of the eight desired capabilities specified as appropriate for graduates to practice as interns. These include a thorough understanding of the biomedical science mechanisms and bio-social determinants that maintain health, contribute to illness, and underlie appropriate management strategies; application of a scientific approach to clinical medicine and medical practice; excellent communicative, teamwork, psychomotor and cognitive skills to assess health issues and patient problems and develop patient-centred management approaches; and demonstrated abilities to work independently, reflectively and within appropriate ethical and legal frameworks.,Clinical learning in phase 3 will be predominantly located in clinical environments associated with the Faculty of Medicine in a range of metropolitan and rural locations throughout New South Wales. Most modules will be available in a variety of clinical locations and students will be able to select an individualised learning program from a menu offered by clinical teaching units, or they may be able to negotiate their program with their clinical supervisors. Students will generally be able to indicate a preference to do the majority of their clinical training attached to one geographical region, but final allocation will be determined by a number of factors including availability of attachments to particular locations, and is ultimately the responsibility and decision of the Faculty. ,Students are required to complete one each of six clinical modules with a specified major focus, these being in the clinical disciplines of Children's Health; Women's Health; Mental Health; Internal Medicine; Surgery; and Chronic & Complex Care, although some choice of the structure, case-mix and location of each of these will generally be possible. In addition to these specified modules, students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete phase 3 requirements. The order and content of work undertaken in these courses will be organised for each student on an individual basis through the relevant Clinical School(s).,In considering their choice of modules in Phase 3, the student's clinical experience must include a minimum of 8 weeks in community or ambulatory settings, as well as 8 weeks experience of emergency or critical care, although these may be spread over one or more individual modules. In addition, a student's combined clinical experiences during phases 2 and 3 must include a minimum of 8 weeks in rural locations, 4 weeks in primary care practice and adequate exposure to various clinical sub-specialities.    ,All clinical modules in phase 3 adopt the principles of clinical clerkship, in which students learn through experience and participation in the treatment of patients under the care of medical practitioners and/or medical teams to which they are attached. Although structured teaching activities are generally limited to an average of 10 hours per week, which will include teaching of relevant biomedical sciences and social sciences, students are required to work under supervision as part of the health care delivery unit. Students' responsibilities as part of the team will increase gradually as new skills are developed. Each module will have demonstrable links to those aspects of basic biomedical and social sciences relevant to the health issues encountered. ,Assessment for each module will focus on the performance of students relative to the desired graduate capabilities.

Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses.,(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Undergraduate,LAWS3331,6,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense. In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take, and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and doctrines, and about the worth of it all. They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided by the legal system, rather than about them.,Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within. It aims to probe and discuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law. Such questions include matters of description and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.,Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed. It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all.,Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.,In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legal positivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legal positivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.,Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.,In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain ‘problems’ of contemporary legal practice. A consideration of the materials for the later classes will show the type of issues that will be discussed: the character of public law (ideas associated with constitutionalism and rule of law), relativism and ‘western’ human rights, and the feminist and postmodern/post-structural challenges to understanding law.,You may have dealt with the present law on some of these matters in other law courses. Here we are interested in what philosophy has to say about these problems.,(a)What kind of beings are we – the legal, moral, liberal subject? Not an ontological question (as to what we are really like) but a question about what is significant about us from the legal, moral, political perspectives.,(b) Role of (practical) reason. How can our laws and our institutions be rational, be justified to free thinking? The character of legal, moral, and political reasoning: including, similarities – between proof and scepticism i.e. inter-subjective character; differences – law a special case (as authority, autonomy...), right/good, instrumental reasoning/value reasoning...,(c) In the background are larger questions of method in social/ethical/legal theory - the proper way to see the division of normative and factual issues. For example, what is the relationship between the cultural understandings of (a) above and what we are really like (for instance, human nature)? And what is the relationship between what is rational to us in Australia now and what is rational in a larger sense (for instance, are human rights universal?)

It begins by exploring the question “what is justice”? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice?

This fosters the assumption that litigation, or legal advice predicting the outcome of litigation, is the normal method of resolving disputes.

Prerequisite: Completion of 78 UOC in LAWS courses.,(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Undergraduate,LAWS3149,6,"This unit explores the emerging complexity of the relation between Law and Biology in the 21th century. It examines the following question: What does the concept ""biology"" do in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as ""nature"", ""bodies"", ""organism"", ""groups"" or ""life"" (to name just a few). ""Theories of Law and Biology"" aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.,The unit complements other units offered at the law school such as “Legal Theory”, “Law and Social Theory”, and “Theories of Law and Justice”. Similar to these units, “Theories of Law and Biology” emphasizes the theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to courses such as “Law and Medical Health” or “Intellectual Property Law” which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that “Theories of Law and Biology” takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that this unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method of thinking and understanding. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system. ,Students wishing to think about law “outside the box"" and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course. It is recommended that students have some knowledge in legal theory through having taken one of the legal theory prescribed electives before enrolling in this course.

We will examine the role of private property law, particularly strata and community title, in constructing the built environment and then managing the people and communities who live there.  For example, should private property law be used not only to mandate what people build on their own land, but how they behave or even dress? Can ""community"" be created in new housing developments or must it develop organically? Should large tracts of bushland or waterfronts, roads, parks or sewerage treatment facilities be privatised or should they remain public assets? We will look at groups of people who have opted out of the city, setting up alternative communes or “utopias” in rural areas with community title legislation.  What is the motivation for these communities and do they work? Students will be introduced to sociological, legal and planning research, as well as studying the real-world application of those theories.  Topics include urban planning; Sydney city and its suburbs; large-scale commercial and residential high rise; master planned, eco and gated communities; child-friendly cities; metropolises of Asia; and urban regeneration.  This course will interest students who like big ideas, and want to explore the social, political, historical, economic and environmental theories that relate to law, land and the people who use them.,More information can be found on the ,.",Faculty of Law,/faculties/2018/law/law.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/LAWS3115.html,3,See below,LAWS3115.html#CourseOutline,Faculty of Law,http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/,"People, Land and Community",http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/LAWS3115.html

They grant foreign investors broad protections from interference by the governments of the countries in which they invest. They also establish an international mechanism for adjudication and enforcement, allowing foreign investors to bypass national courts and, instead, bring cases against states directly to international arbitration. The amount at stake in these disputes regularly runs into billions of dollars. Philip Morris’ recent case against Australia arising from Australia’s tobacco plain packaging legislation is a high profile example. Supporters argue that investment treaties promote foreign investment and respect for the rule of law in countries that are bound by them. Critics argue that investment treaties constitute a ‘bill of rights for multinational corporations’ that is enforced through ‘secret courts’. ,This course provides an introduction to the law and policy of the investment treaty regime.

It begins by exploring the question “what is justice”? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice?

Juris Doctor students who commenced prior to 2013 need no pre-requisites.,(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Undergraduate,LAWS2320,6,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory. The course is , in the following sense.  In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take, and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and doctrines, and about the worth of it all.  They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules.  Customarily they think , the categories and arrangements provided by the legal system, rather than , them. ,Legal Theory is concerned to think , precisely those frameworks that lawyers think ,.  It aims to probe and discuss theoretical questions about law, which , the practical stuff of the law.  Such questions include matters of description and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what , be going on? Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.,Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed.  It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all. ,Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.,In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – , as a dominant approach to understanding law and , as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legal positivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.,Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.,In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain ‘problems’ of contemporary legal practice. A consideration of the materials for the later classes will show the type of issues that will be discussed:  the character of public law (ideas associated with constitutionalism and rule of law), relativism and ‘western’ human rights, and the feminist and postmodern/post-structural challenges to understanding law.,You may have dealt with the present law on some of these matters in other law courses. Here we are interested in what philosophy has to say about these problems.,(a)What kind of beings are we – the legal, moral, liberal subject? Not an ontological question (as to what we are really like) but a question about what is significant about us from the legal, moral, political perspectives.,(b) Role of (practical) reason. How can our laws and our institutions be rational, be justified to free thinking? The character of legal, moral, and political reasoning: including, similarities – between proof and scepticism i.e. inter-subjective character; differences – law a special case (as authority, autonomy...), right/good, instrumental reasoning/value reasoning...,(c) In the background are larger questions of method in social/ethical/legal theory - the proper way to see the division of normative and factual issues. For example, what is the relationship between the cultural understandings of (a) above and what we are really like (for instance, human nature)? And what is the relationship between what is rational to us in Australia now and what is rational in a larger sense (for instance, are human rights universal?)

This course is worth 6 units of credit. It complements, and is studied in the same session as, LAWS1124 - ,., ,CFLS develops students’ understanding of the functioning of the legal system and facility with foundational legal skills that students acquired in LAWS1121 – ,. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts and legal paradigms in three core areas of substantive law: contract; tort and criminal law. The course focuses on students’ acquisition of legal problem-solving skills in both oral and written contexts to enhance students’ understanding of legal principles found in case and statute law in these three fields. It provides preparation for, and an introduction to, the study of Contract, Tort and Criminal Law in the LLB program., ,A good grounding in the basic principles of contract law is a fundamental element of any legal education. This Module is an introduction to the study of voluntarily assumed legal obligations which govern many important areas of daily life. This Module focuses on students acquiring a sound understanding of a number of basic principles of contract law, through common law method, with particular focus on the elements required for the formation of a valid contract, namely offer and acceptance; consideration; intention to create legal relations; certainty and privity., ,The aims of the Criminal Justice module are to introduce students to foundational elements of the criminal law, and some key issues related to criminal justice. The course will include an examination of the components of criminal offences generally, and will take two substantive offences (murder and offensive language/behaviour) to see how these elements play out in practice., ,This module covers the part of the law of torts which signifies, broadly speaking, the law determining liability to pay compensation for wrongfully caused injury, damage or loss through medical negligence.,The prime objective is to introduce students to the core principles of negligence, including a critical understanding of the policy considerations informing the law. A second objective of this course is to examine a relatively limited number of leading cases and legislation in selected areas and thereby develop skills of analysis, synthesis and evaluation. A third objective is to encourage students to consider the way in which the law of torts operates in the context of society as a whole, and the ways in which it is influenced by such particular factors as insurance, social security, and the need (or absence of a need) to ascribe fault. Thus there is a theoretical component to the course which introduces various debates about the nature and effectiveness of tort law.,More information can be found on the ,.",Faculty of Law,/faculties/2018/law/law.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/LAWS1123.html,4,See below,LAWS1123.html#CourseOutline,Faculty of Law,http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/,Conceptual Foundations of the Legal System ,http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/LAWS1123.html

Students will acquire an understanding of the introductory principles and theories of administrative and constitutional law as they apply to the essential features of the Australian system of government, and their implications for human rights and the rule of law. The course exposes students to this material through an examination of Australia’s hybrid constitutional inheritance from the United Kingdom and United States, as adapted in the creation and subsequent development of the federal Commonwealth. In doing so it also examines the implications of colonisation for Indigenous legal systems and assertions of Crown sovereignty. The role, powers and interrelationship of the three arms of government are considered in contemporary as well as historical context, as are the issues of rights protection and constitutional change. The course prepares students for their later study of the courses LAWS1160: Administrative Law and LAWS2150: Federal Constitutional Law, and also introduces students to the fundamentals of the skill of statutory interpretation in the public law context.

The course focuses on teaching ‘how’ to undertake and analyse research methods through experiential learning and the use of contemporary and familiar case study examples of research topics relevant to international studies. We will get out of the classroom and practice what we are learning. The course will introduce both traditional methods (for example, discourse analysis, surveys and interviews) as well as innovative methods that draw on the affective turn as well as digital ethnography (for example, embodied observation, sonic movement, photo elicitation and geo-tagging). Underpinning this tuition of research methods is the rationale for generating data through research methods in the first place.  All research undertaken with people in international landscapes will involve research methods to understand the interactions, mobilities, modifications, attachments and feelings to, and about those landscapes. This course will equip you with the skills to conduct research methods yourself but it will also develop your awareness of how the data you use is generated, as well as providing the contextual foundation in research ethics and researcher positionality.",Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,/faculties/2018/artsc/artsc.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/INST2003.html,3,School of Humanities & Languages,http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/,School of Humanities and Languages,https://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/,Research Methods in International Studies ,http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/INST2003.html

The goal of this course is to provide you with the basic tools to “think like an economist” – that is, to be able to use basic economic principles to ask and answer questions about how the world works or the effects of policies. We will cover topics such as how individuals or firms make decisions about the demand or supply of a product, how we can determine the efficiency of a market, and how we evaluate the costs and benefits of government intervention in a market.,This course is offered in both a traditional lecture/tutorial format and a blended section. In the blended section, students learn the lecture content and interact with lecturers online but still attend a weekly tutorial on campus. ,The blended section gives students to flexibility to learn the course content when and where they choose, while receiving personalised feedback throughout the semester both online through the course website and in person in weekly tutorials.,Students enrolled in a traditional lecture section are expected to attend both lectures and tutorials each week and will also have access to the course’s online features.

Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.,The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure & conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.,Whereas the first part presents ""default"" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing).

Co-Req: BENV0001,(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Undergraduate,CODE1150,6,"Computational Design I (Fundamentals)’ is the first of three Computational Design courses that introduces students to Computational Design. Students are introduced to computational geometry and algebra in order to design and develop through Grasshopper 3D small objects and artifacts. Students will produce in this course innovative geometry that will shape the form, space and detail of architectural environments, produced via digital fabrication techniques 3D printing and laser cutting. To achieve this they will engage with cutting edge and developing digital modelling applications, techniques and cultures. The course will aim to develop your skills in using digital technology to experiment and generate creative architectonic geometries. A weekly lecture will develop themes relating to the culture and application of complex geometries and algebra within the digital or computational context, and propose conceptual challenges that drive the edges of our current understanding. Within the context of this course, modelling applications will be used as a medium for testing and manipulating digital forms. We will review the nature and scope of modelling concepts in a more general context, looking at its history, evolution, applications and potentiality as a design tool. Theoretical knowledge will be presented under some broad concepts: Topological Architectures, Influenced Architectures, Dynamics and Motion, Generative Forms, Parametric Design, Evolving Architectures, Digital Fabrication, Digital Manipulation, Digital Optimization and Performance. You will engage in weekly lab classes to experiment and develop with complex geometries. Assessment will be based on your progressive performance in the lab class, exams to assess online content (Grasshopper and Rhino) and a number of assessable tasks that will demonstrate the evolution of your explorations.",Built Environment,/faculties/2018/blten/blten.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/CODE1150.html,5,Computational Design,http://www.be.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate-degrees/computational-design-code/program-details,Built Environment,http://www.be.unsw.edu.au/,Computational Design I (Fundamentals) ,http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/CODE1150.html
No Enrolment Requirements,(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Undergraduate,CODE1110,6,"This course is part of the practice orientated teaching trajectory ‘Constructing’, Path 1: Computational Design Theory. The course is situated in the ‘Beginner Level’ in the CoDe student specialisation journey and therefore available for enrolment as an elective for all other UNSW undergrad students.,With the “digital turn” in architecture since 1992 as coined by architectural historian Mario Carpo, it is necessary to survey how computational design has emerged from the discipline of architecture and is forcing it into a field of “architectures”. Computational Design Theory sits in between all three practice-orientated teaching trajectories (Place & Technology, Form & Experience, Space & Documentation) and links them together through a theoretical and conceptual understanding developed by thinking and working through theory and practice. ,The aim of Computational Design Theory I is to introduce and evaluate the role of Theory in fostering a new way of “constructing” the digital in architecture and the expanded field of creative industries linking representation, fabrication and construction. It will serve as the foundation of the tripartite theory stream, which positions students to the brief history, the concept and theoretical formation of the digital design. It consists of lectures, discussion in tutorials, online learning, and assignments.,In 12 lectures, the course will track a range of the thematic essential to the ‘digital turn’ and link them to the debates within design culture and critical theory. Students will be introduced to a range of theoretical themes: from Alphabet to Algorithm, Folding in Architecture, Nonlineraity, Hypersurfaces, Parametric Thinking vs. Parametricism and so on. Each lecture will be accompanied by the analysis of selected projects. Together with the required weekly readings, these projects present an overview of opportunities for the content and practice of computational design.  ,Assignments are designed in two folds: 1) develop student’s ability in critical thinking and active theorization for a position through reading, writing and analysing design projects; 2) allow students to practice and explore the skills in software learned from other courses.",Built Environment,/faculties/2018/blten/blten.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/CODE1110.html,4,Computational Design,http://www.be.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate-degrees/computational-design-code/program-details,Built Environment,http://www.be.unsw.edu.au/,Computational Design Theory 1,http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/CODE1110.html

Unfortunately, only a small proportion of people ever gain more than a superficial understanding of natural selection and how evolution works.

It will introduce you to the practice of thesis writing and support you in the early stages of developing your honours argument. This course includes topics such as: using library resources for honours students including research consultation and access to databases; the role of methods in research and the use of theory in framing and conducting a research project in the social sciences; your ethical responsibilities as a researcher; and planning and managing a research project. The course introduces you to the idea of framing your research as an intervention in a disciplinary debate (or series of debates). The subject features student-lead study groups which are a forum in which you can discuss your research progress and provide peer feedback on your colleague's draft chapters. You will also experience presenting your research to students-peers and academic members of staff in a viva situation.

Presidents and prime ministers are often depicted as all-powerful individuals. However, for their own political survival, leaders are dependent on a range of relationships with other people and organisations and have to act in circumstances not of their choosing.  ,This course explores these complexities through examining democracies around the world. This course will focus on Australian prime ministers and American presidents. You will learn about political elites, citizens and intermediary organisations between citizens and leaders. You will learn to identify the different and conflicting roles of these political actors, the interactions between them, and the conditions under which conflict or cooperation occurs.

And what kind of body does Western philosophy assume, when it addresses the body at all? Is the body always already a gendered body? This course introduces students to ideas about the body and how embodiment has been theorised by the Western philosophical tradition. The course will consider the apparent relationship between the body and ‘the human’, the body and reason, and the body and creativity, among other questions. A guiding thread for the course is the question: Is the body always already a gendered body? Early modern philosophy from Descartes pitted the body against the mind, and also identified 'man' with the mind while 'woman' was understood to be associated with bodily processes. The course prompts students to ask: What has been the significance of this way of thinking about the relation of body and mind to gender politics? How have philosophers, and particularly philosophers of feminism, challenged this schema? And to what extent does contemporary philosophy continue to struggle with the question of the body? ,Key philosophers the course covers may include Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson, Freud, Merleau-Ponty, Beauvoir, Foucault, Deleuze, Butler, Irigaray, Kristeva, Lloyd, Harraway, Bordo, Marion-Young, Ahmed, Grosz and Diprose.",Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,/faculties/2018/artsc/artsc.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/ARTS2910.html,3,School of Humanities & Languages,http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/,School of Humanities and Languages,https://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/,Philosophy and the Body ,http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/ARTS2910.html

By starting in the Ancient world, you will learn that people and societies have not always understood sexual behaviour to equate with a sexual identity, such as ‘homosexual’ or ‘heterosexual’. ‘Sexuality’ then is a modern phenomenon. To comprehend this, we will examine why masturbation suddenly became a very big ‘problem’ in the 18th century and why sex was increasingly regulated from the 19th century. We chart the growth of new forms of sexual knowledge and ponder feminist critiques of Freud and other sex ‘experts’. We wind up in the twentieth century, with not one but several sexual revolutions.

We begin with questions that are fundamental to gender studies – such as ‘what is gender?’ – and trace them across time and place to demonstrate how gender intersects with race, class, sexuality and other markers in different historical and cultural contexts. You will consider how religion, colonialism, nationalism and cross-cultural contacts have shaped and influenced gender roles and relations. The course also introduces you to key debates and developments in gender studies and gender history, from the question of the role of gender in early modern witch-hunts, through Judith Butler’s influential theorising of gender and embodiment, and the emergence of trans studies and intersectional theory.",Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,/faculties/2018/artsc/artsc.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/ARTS1900.html,3,School of Humanities & Languages,http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/,School of Humanities and Languages,https://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/,Gendered Worlds: Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies ,http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/ARTS1900.html

No Enrolment Requirements,(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Undergraduate,ARTS1810,6," Where does power lie in politics? Whose explanations about how the world works are valued and why? This course will equip you with some of the skills necessary to begin formulating your own answers to these questions. You will be introduced to the idea of studying politics, both domestic and international, as an academic discipline, and to some of the key academic conventions and standards that are important to the discipline: the idea of evidence-based argument, for example, and the idea of ethical scholarship. We will also discuss the formation of the modern state system and interrogate the conceptualisation of the state that informs much contemporary theory and practice in politics at the national and international level.,A substantial part of this course is devoted to the introduction of the main theoretical traditions that animate the study of politics and international relations. One of the central messages of the course is that different theoretical approaches generate different images of the world that build on particular assumptions. Therefore, while people may think they know what the current problems of politics and global politics are and how to solve them, one of the aims of this course is to alert you to other ways of seeing things. This should allow you to make a more confident decision about your own stance towards particular issues and to analyse these issues more thoroughly, but it should also make you question both your own and others’ representations of the world.",Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,/faculties/2018/artsc/artsc.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/ARTS1810.html,3,School of Social Sciences,http://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/,School of Social Sciences,http://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/,Foundations of Politics and International Relations ,http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/ARTS1810.html

International development has been under intense critique for failing to improve the conditions for people in recipient communities. Without doubt, many mistakes have been made and have left people and countries worse off than before. Also without doubt development has and is happening across the world. ,This introductory course – designed to complement , explores these and other questions by examining the origins of development as an idea, goal and practice, the conceptual and theoretical aspects underpinning Development Studies as a discipline, debates about development in theory and practice as well as the role of these theories and debates in shaping the contemporary world. ,You will learn why development thinking – and by extension development practices – has changed over time, and the extent to which its architects have learnt from past failure and successes.,Throughout this historical journey of development as a theory and practice, you will be exposed to a variety of geographic case studies to examine the role of key development actors as well as concepts and issues. You will leave this course with an appreciation about the complexities of development and with a solid foundation of what has been learned from past failures and successes of development assistance and what might be better approaches to change people’s lives.",Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences,/faculties/2018/artsc/artsc.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/ARTS1750.html,3,School of Social Sciences,http://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/,School of Social Sciences,http://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/,Introduction to Development Studies ,http://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2018/ARTS1750.html

During the last two decades of the 20th century computers, digitisation and information technology have contributed to significant changes in graphic design.  Parallel to these changes are the cultural, socio-economic and political perspectives on graphics and the representation of national experience.  These profound changes affect the way knowledge is produced and consumed just as the invention of printing transformed the dissemination of information in Renaissance Europe.  Although the digital revolution has transformed the roles, working methods, project management and production processes for designers and printers, the digitisation of text and pictures has also exerted a compelling influence on the aesthetics and designing of the graphic image in print and electronic media for a global audience. ,Graphic design is a social activity in which the digital reconfiguration of the image engenders new forms of visual experiences.  The course content addresses theoretical and methodological issues in the production and consumption of graphics, in particular cross-cultural significance in contemporary society, including form and function in global communication design; pictorial and narrative structures in visual communication; systems of icons and symbols as a global visual language, and the influence of technology on aesthetics and visual experience. ,This fully online course comprises a series of lectures, learning activities and assessment tasks delivered via the Internet using an engaging interface that specifically supports textual and visual communication.
