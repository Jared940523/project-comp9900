Work Diary

week2
Group formed. After discussion in the lab, we had an agreement about which topic we will do. According to the given three topic, we decided to attempt the topic 1 - X-o-Bot. After the lab, I tried to search some information about chat robot on the internet. Finally, I found a python library called "ChatterBot" which will be very useful for our project and I recommended it to my teammate.
