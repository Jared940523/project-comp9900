Work Diary

week2
Group formed. After discussion in the lab, we had an agreement about which topic we will do. According to the given three topic, we decided to attempt the topic 1 - X-o-Bot. After the lab, I tried to search some information about chat robot on the internet. Finally, I found a python library called "ChatterBot" which will be very useful for our project and I recommended it to my teammate.

week3
In this week, we have a discussion about the project proposal in the lab and split the project to three parts which are database, chat robot and user interface. For me, I will do the database system and make a connection to the robot part. I complete the epic about database system module in the project proposal and decide to use MySQL as the database management system. In the lab, we also discuss what the queries category will be such as subject requirements, course information and degree information. So in the next week, I will do the information retrieval and web search for providing data to the database system.

week4
In this week, I try to grab some course information in postgraduate coursework from UNSW 2018 handbook website. As I am not familiar with the spider tools, I do some research on the Internet. I found that there is an open source and collaborative framework called "Scrapy" which is fast and simple for extracting the data from the websites. Then I read the documentation about this framework and started the project. Now I have completed the extraction of some main course information such as course code, course title and course credit. The code of this part has been uploaded to the GitHub. In the next week, I will extract some detail information about all courses. If time available, I will try to save the information to the database system.
