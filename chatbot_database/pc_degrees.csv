"9314","http://www.artdesign.unsw.edu.au/","2 Years  ","96","The Master of Art is a postgraduate coursework program that provides a comprehensive interdisciplinary postgraduate experience in contemporary Fine Arts practices. The program is designed to provide a critically nurturing learning atmosphere in which experimentation and skills acquisition are encouraged. An innovative studio environment supports the development and growth of critically informed creative practices, developed in the context of contemporary ideas and alert to the continuing influence of historical precedent. The program allows students to develop a professional approach to researching, developing and fulfilling their creative aspirations, and to transition from student to self-aware practicing artist.The Master of Art has two main components: a core that addressed significant themes and practices in contemporary art and studio-based classes in key areas of practice. In the art core you will learn about the central and evolving concepts and practices of contemporary fine art studio practice, to help you situate yourself in a world marked by interdisciplinarity, new and innovative engagement with materials and methods, and the necessity of experimentation and innovation.   The studio-based courses enable you to either focus on a specific area of practice (see below), or to put together your own suite of courses.The program culminates in a major project and paper, which enables you to integrate your creative practice and develop as a creative arts professional.Studio courses are available in the following areas of practice:Planar Practices Studio - which engages with creative practices that are image based and exhibited primarily on the wall. It supports the developments of individual and collaborative practices in painting, drawing, printmaking and forms of photography that are experienced primarily as a still image and video as a wall based projection.Temporal and Spatial Studio - which facilitates creative practices where the artist, working alone or with others, creates works of art that are experienced in time and space. It supports creative practices such as video, animation, sculpture, installation, performance, audio and experimental approaches to image capture.Future Making Studio - which focuses on the making of objects, whether with new materials and digital technologies or traditional craftsmanship. It addresses the integration of technical knowledge and skills with material and contextual understanding. Future Making works with ceramics, jewellery, metal, textiles, furniture and lighting.As well, students may take studio courses from areas of practice offered in Program 9313 Master of Design.","The Master of Art is a 96 UOC [2 year FT] program, with options for students to complete either a 72 UOC [1.5 years FT] program, or a 48 UOC [1 year FT] program with advanced standing, depending on background of the entering student.

The specialist pathways taken as part of the MCP may direct students towards more specialist areas, for example in housing, urban renewal, environmental management, heritage or urban design related professions. The interdisciplinary skill sets developed through the degree also enable graduates move into wider policy, research, analytical, creative and community roles both in Australia and overseas.","The MCP is a 2-year 96uoc degree, and can be taken full-time or part-time. Students from a ‘cognate’ undergraduate background are able to apply for up to 24uoc through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) (see below), enabling the MCP to be completed within three full-time semesters or equivalent. CORE COURSES (54uoc)Core courses [54uoc] collectively offer a strong foundation in the key knowledge and skills required of all planners. They fulfill the need to a) ground students in the foundations or pillars of a planning education (sustainability, economic, equity issues), b) develop an understanding of the defining components of a planning qualification (planning law, land use policy and practice, strategic spatial planning) and c) more detailed knowledge and skills development (planning techniques and analysis, urban design, city building)Core (Foundational and cognate knowledge)PLAN7142 City Equity & Wellbeing (6 UOC)PLAN7146 City Econ,Urban Dev & Fin (6 UOC)SUSD0001 - Sustainable Development and the Urban Environment (6UOC)**May be replaced with SUSD0004 Sustainability and Habitability (6UOC)Core (Disciplinary knowledge)PLAN7140 Land & Environment Law (6 UOC)PLAN7141 Land Use Policy & Practice (6 UOC)PLAN7148 Strategic Spatial Planning (6 UOC)Core (Disciplinary skills)PLAN7143 Urban Design (6 UOC)PLAN7145 City Building - Infrastructure (6 UOC)PLAN7147 Planning Techniques & Analysis (6 UOC)SPECIALIST PATHWAYS (24uoc)The MCP offers four specialist pathways enabling students to strengthen their area of interest and expertise. 1.

At UNSW, we engage with the campus, the surrounding city and the Sydney region as our landscape laboratory, and encourage our students to engage with international issues and experiences. The core of the program is the design studio sequence, with each studio supported by a skill and/or knowledge-based course.

Courses offered in the LLM by Coursework program combine a degree of sophistication or technical difficulty in terms of legal content with a substantial consideration of relevant international, professional and interdisciplinary aspects of the subject matter. By undertaking eight of the many , varied courses on offer, all students will have the opportunity to apply their legal knowledge and skills by undertaking at least one substantial, research-based project.","The LLM by Coursework may be taken full-time in 2 semesters or part-time in a minimum of 3 semesters. Students must undertake and satisfactorily complete 8 semester-long courses or the equivalent. A total of 48 units of credit (uoc) is required for the award of the degree.Students may, but are not required to, elect to complete a major sequence of courses, known as a specialisation (see below). Successful completion of the requirements of both the LLM by Coursework and the specialisation entitled the student to receive the name of the specialisation in parentheses after Master of Laws on the students testamur.Postgraduate courses are taught in a variety of formats both during the University's formal academic semesters and over the Summer Term. While some are taught for two hours per week over a teaching semester, in others the class hours are arranged more intensively to permit students to focus fully on a research project.Course RequirementsThe requirements for the Master of Laws by Coursework are as follows:For local students- 8 courses from the list of LAWS (and, depending on the specialisation, TABL) courses set out in the Handbook on a yearly basis, to the value of 48 uocFor international students from a non-common law background- LAWS8271 Australian Legal System and 7 courses from the list of LAWS (and, depending on the specialisation, TABL) courses set out in the Handbook on a yearly basis, to the value of 48 uoc.For all students-A minimum of 2 of the 8 courses must be taken from an approved list of courses that contain a substantial research-based assessment component (the Research-Based Course List). The full list of courses contained in the Research-Based Course List will be set out in the Handbook on a yearly basis. New courses can be added to the Research-Based Course List at the election of the Faculty of Law Standing Committee, provided that the course contains a research-based assessment task of a minimum of 6,000 words. The requirement to take two courses from the Research-Based Course List can, in the alternative, be satisfied if the student takes the single course LAWS8423 Research Thesis: 6 uoc.A student may apply to the Postgraduate Education Co-ordinator for permission to take up to 2 courses (12 uoc) of the program from courses offered at postgraduate level by another university via cross institutional study. A student may apply to complete a semester of study (24uoc) with the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. The University of Lausanne offers instruction in English in the LLM in International and European Economic Law or International and European Commercial Law. The courses undertaken at the University of Lausanne will be credited to your UNSW LLM degree. Refer to the UNSW Law Exchange website for further information.Specialisations (Plans)Candidates for the LLM by Coursework may undertake study incorporating a major sequence in any one of the following specialist areas:Corporate and Commercial LawCorporate, Commercial and Taxation LawCriminal Justice and CriminologyDispute ResolutionEnvironmental LawHuman Rights and Social JusticeInnovation LawInternational LawInternational Business and Economic LawMedia and Technology LawTaxation LawIn order to incorporate a specialisation a student will be required to obtain at least 24 of the 48 uoc required for the award of the degree from the courses allocated to that major sequence.The following specialisations have particular requirements:In order to meet requirements for a specialisation in Corporate, Commercial and Taxation Law, candidates must complete 48uoc as follows:- 18 uoc from courses offered in the Corporate and Commercial Law major sequence;- 18 uoc from postgraduate taxation courses offered by the School of Taxation and Business Law, UNSW Business School- 12 uoc may be selected from any postgraduate law or taxation courses on offer.In order to meet requirements for a specialisation in Environmental Law, candidates must complete at least 24 uoc of their 48 uoc from courses offered in the Environmental Law specialisation, which must include LAWS8068 Environmental Law and LAWS8319 International Environmental Law.From time to time the allocation of courses to specialisations may be altered.The Postgraduate Education Co-ordinator may, if considering it appropriate:authorise the inclusion of a Special Elective within, or the deletion of a Special Elective from among, the courses allocated to a specialisation.approve as part of an individual student's specialisation a course or courses taken by that student on a cross-institutional basis.Where a special case is made, or where an individual students' assessment program for a course outside a specialisation is tailored specifically to issues relevant to a specialisation, the Postgraduate Education Co-ordinator may approve a course not otherwise allocated to a major sequence as part of that student's specialisation. Research Thesis courses may be counted towards the units of credit required for a specialisation where, in the opinion of the Postgraduate Education Co-ordinator, the subject matter of the thesis topic is substantially related to the specialist area of the major sequence. When a student completes the LLM by Coursework incorporating a specialisation as above, upon request by the student, the students' academic transcript will identify the specialisation and the courses which constitute it and the student's Testamur will contain the words 'Master of Laws in (the specialisation completed)' or words to that effect."

It is open to students from a media background, law background, or who have previously undertaken a Bachelors degree but have no prior experience in either media or law.As new media moves towards becoming the dominant form of mass communication, it is important for individuals from a range of backgrounds - law, government, business, journalism, corporate communications - to understand how best to use these emergent platforms and the legal rights and responsibilities that accompany such usage. In terms of the law, established doctrines including defamation and privacy are being used in new ways to cope with the regulatory impact of this increased reliance on the digital sphere. With the Australian Government committed to increasing engagement with social media and a growing number of brands appearing on Facebook and Twitter, it is important for individuals at all levels of business and government to have a solid grasp of how to most effectively use these new platforms and understand the accompanying legal boundaries.The interdisciplinary focus of the degree equips students with a theoretical focus and practical skills. Students will have the opportunity to learn how to communicate via a series of media, whether in print, broadcasting or online. In turn, students will supplement these practical skills by developing an understanding of the regulatory context in which those skills can be used. The program is structured to allow students to undertake courses according to their interest or employment and thus a student may elect to focus on the practical skills required for broadcasting media and the regulation surrounding that platform, or solely on digital media and the privacy, defamation and online content regulation issues that accompany that area. Students may also elect to do additional law electives that will enhance their understanding of a particular area of law and allow them to reflect on that area in the context of the overall degree.","Candidates for the MLMJ must undertake 48 uoc to complete the program. 24 uoc must be obtained in Media & Journalism (MDIA) and 24 uoc must be obtained in Law (LAWS)."

The foremost expectation is effective leadership, particularly in the development and delivery of public policy. Public leadership transcending organisational management is expected within communities concerned with practical outcomes; agencies committed to regional issues; and, institutions with oversight of national priorities. Despite the substantial premium placed on public leadership, few theorists and even fewer practitioners have closely examined the challenges of exercising public leadership in a range of contexts or the relationship between public leadership and policy formulation. The Master of Public Leadership and Policy uniquely addresses this gap by offering students a combination of courses focused specifically on public leadership alongside a rich selection of electives addressing broader issues related to local, national and global policy and its implementation.","Students undertaking this program are required to take 8 courses (48 UOC) comprising 24 UOC of core courses, with the remaining courses selected in any combination from the elective courses listed below.Core CoursesStudents must complete 24 UOC from core courses:1.

It can be used as a higher degree qualifying program (for students who do not meet criteria for direct entry to Honours or MSc/PhD programs), to upgrade existing qualifications or to develop expertise in a different but related disciplinary area from that of the first degree. Students who qualify to enrol in the Honours program would generally be expected to do so rather than enrol in this Graduate Diploma (Research) program. As part of the program students are expected to complete disciplinary coursework of 18-24 UOC and a significant independent research project of 24-30 UOC. As the Faculty has a diverse range of disciplines the exact proportion of research-based work and coursework may differ by School. Students should refer to the plan pages in this Handbook entry for details of the requirement for their chosen discipline. In addition to conducting research and coursework students will also be expected to undertake Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) training, attend and present seminars, write a literature review, and write a thesis."," Admission Requirements and ProcessTo be accepted for admission into the program students are typically expected to have a Bachelor degree with a good pass in a related, but not necessarily directly relevant discipline to their chosen area of study. Due to the diverse nature of the disciplines within the program, details of acceptable disciplines considered for admission are shown in relevant plan pages in the Handbook. A 'good pass' is considered to be a weighted average mark of 55-64. However, particular disciplines within Science may have additional entry requirements due to the competitive nature of some disciplines and the number of research places available within a School.Applicants with substantial professional experience which demonstrates an aptitude for research or significant understanding in a discipline area, will be considered for admission. These students will need to include a written submission with their application detailing their professional experience and its relevance to undertaking a research program, and also a statement of service from their employer verifying the position, role and responsibilities, and duration of employment. This application will be assessed by the Associate Dean (Education).To apply for admission to the Graduate Diploma (Research), students should contact the relevant School for information on research projects, available supervisors, and entry requirements. Once students have located a suitable supervisor, they should lodge an application for the Graduate Diploma (Research) via  Apply Online.No advanced standing will be granted to students upon entry as students are expected to complete a full 48 units of credit to receive the award of Graduate Diploma (Research).Program StructureThe Graduate Diploma (Research) is comprised of 48 units of credit. It typically includes 18-24 UOC of coursework and 24-30 UOC of an independent research project under the guidance of an academic supervisor culminating in a written thesis. The program normally commences in semester 1 and is undertaken full-time over 1 year. However mid-year entry and part-time enrolment may be available at the discretion of the relevant School.

"8132","http://www.be.unsw.edu.au/","1.5 Years  ","72","The sustainability challenge of the 21st century has moved from sustainability education (i.e. awareness and information) to education for sustainability, i.e. how to make it happen. The Master of Sustainable Built Environment is structured around this approach. Education for sustainability is about empowering professionals to take on the challenge, it is transformative rather than merely transmissive, it is holistic and driven by critical thinking, and ultimately is about becoming a champion for change. The task begins with ways of thinking as well as considering the differing value systems and cultures which influence the ways communities shape their built environments.The Master of Sustainable Built Environment provides the opportunity to explore these challenges in depth and adapt them to the needs of diverse professional and cultural settings. This program takes a global view and places it in a local context. It is both academically interdisciplinary and linked to practical application in industry.  This program responds to the increasing demand for built environment and related professionals with the capacity to meet the growing challenges of sustainable development in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and the expansion of specialised career opportunities in both the public and private sector.  It provides evidence-based tools for thinking, analysis, synthesis and decision making to support the planning, design, construction and management of a sustainable built environment, from room to region.Admission Requirements:A minimum four year Bachelor degree or equivalent from a recognised tertiary institution in a relevant field such as the Built Environment disciplines or related areas such as environmental science or engineering is required for admission to the Masters Program.  All applicants must have achieved a minimum of a credit average (equivalent to a WAM of 65 or above) in their Bachelor degree.

The program is Design Studio based, multi-disciplinary and includes a compulsory fieldtrip and workshop in a major international city. The program offers advanced study in the growth and change of urban form. The program connects with fellow universities, city agencies and professionals to integrate latest urban development practice with creative design responses to the challenge of making the 21st century city. An intense combination of coursework and design research is explored in studios, theory seminars, case studies and field projects. The MUDD Extension Program provides a deeper critical understanding and design techniques for bourgeoning cities and older urban regions facing structural change considered in relation to Sydney as a Global City, which we investigate as a continuing case study in urban design. The additional research/design semester component at the end of the three semesters is an advanced disciplinary semester critically engaged with current and higher order research in urban development and design as preparation for new practice frontiers and/or a higher degree. Responding to the complex challenges generated by the pace and scale of urbanisation in our time, the MUDD Extension Program seeks the creative synthesis of three fields of urban research:Spatial political economy – the manifestation in urban form of global patterns of capital formation, investment and disinvestmentUrban design principles and paradigms – normative models of ‘good city form’ grounded in aesthetic, social and environmental concernsUrban design as public policy – the intersection of public policy, design principles, governance and defense of the public realm with stakeholders and the development sector","The content of the program is progressive, stressing theoretical knowledge of economic, social, environmental and physical design determinants at the beginning, and moving into more applied skills and applications toward the end of the program. The nature of contribution to studio-based design projects will be determined according to academic and professional background.To qualify for the Master of Urban Development degree, students are required to complete ten core courses  and two elective course to accumulate a total of 96 UOC.The compulsory core includes five lecture/seminar based courses, a research project, three project based studio courses, and a communications course.
