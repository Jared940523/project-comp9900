Week 2:
  Created the GitHub repository and Trello board for the group. We
  discussed what project we would do, and ended up with topic 1:
  X-o-Bot. Using my experience in web design, I created a basic
  prototype of a front end webpage in which a user can type in their
  query and it sends off a request to a server.

Week 3:
  We defined the project more precisely, coming to the agreement that
  we'll make a bot that functions similarly to the student center at
  UNSW. The user will type in their question, something like "What
  courses should I do this semester?", and the app will respond with
  an appropriate response. We also delegated tasks for both the proposal
  writing and the project itself. I appointed myself to do the front
  end for both the website and the mobile app.

Week 4:
  Created a prototype for the front end webpage. This wasn't too difficult,
  but it's a very necessary part as the main purpose of this app is for
  users to have a very convenient way to ask questions to the bot. I also
  created a small basic flask server for the purpose of testing sending
  and receiving responses to and from a server.
