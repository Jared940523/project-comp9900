Military leaders must, therefore, be conversant with the relevant moral conventions and ethical principles associated with armed conflict and familiar with the decision-making techniques needed to apply them in a way that will enable success in complex environments. Leaders must concurrently be acquainted with the gap between the individual moral frameworks found in multi-cultural liberal democratic societies and the international treaties and domestic laws that regulate the use of military force.

The student will examine contextual differences in the exercise of public leadership and the appeal and application of different leadership styles and strategies to achieve specific outcomes on the way to political renewal and cultural transformation. The course will equip the student to determine the effectiveness of public leadership against a series of criteria related directly to the common good and the public interest.",UNSW Canberra at ADFA,/faculties/2018/adfa/adfa.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/ZHSS8502.html,0,ZHSS8502 Course Outline,https://gateway.unsw.adfa.edu.au/isas/current_students/outlines/index.html,School of Humanities and Social Sciences @ UNSW Canberra at ADFA,http://hass.unsw.adfa.edu.au/,Practice of Public Leadership ,http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2018/ZHSS8502.html

In brief, it is leadership that does not seek to preference or prejudice the needs or desires of any group at the expense of others or to advance personal or private aspirations and objectives to the detriment of the collective wellbeing of the entire citizenry. Public leadership is indifferent to polemical agendas and partisan goals, and transcends the practical preoccupations of administration and management. This course begins with interpretations of competing and contrasting definitions of the ‘public’; provides a basis for identifying and then differentiating ‘leadership’ from oversight, supervision and management; canvasses the elements and imperatives of reliable and responsible leadership; and, offers students a template for describing the possible objectives and outcomes of ‘public leadership’ in a range of professional settings.

Taking the normal definition of diplomacy as the management on the international stage of all a country's cross-border interests, the course engages primarily with four questions:,- the information economy as a foundation for national welfare and security;,- privacy and personal security in cyberspace;,- strategies for national security in cyber space;,- Australian diplomacy on these issues.,The World Economic Forum, working with the Australian Industry Group, has painted a picture of Australians as good at uptake of digital technologies for social purposes but weaker at applying them in business and industry. Australia’s economic competitors are moving rapidly into higher levels of digital innovation at the same time as our leading trade partners and neighbours in Asia have unmet demand for services in the digital economy. Inside Australia, the environment for decision-making on policy for the information age is operating on narrow pathways. The picture of our digital economy is one of falling competitiveness and only medium (to low) levels of innovation. New cyber threats and capabilities are emerging on the military and espionage scenes to which Australia must adapt and respond. But the country needs a digital age strategy for its civil sector before it can have a digital military strategy. The experience levels that key decision-makers have of the IT sector do not in many cases match the nature of the diverse problems. Perhaps the Defence organisation in Australia can take something of a lead to reverse this situation in the country as a whole. But it would need to recognise at the outset that the level of expertise in Australia in military applications in this field, as in many other countries, is low. We need new foreign allies in this field. The effort will need to be multi-national, multi-sector and private-public. In grappling with the large problems of national innovation strategies and national security issues, all actors have had to confront the social and legal impacts of advanced information technologies as well. The debate over privacy and metadata laws for security surveillance is just one example of the myriad ethical questions Australia has had to confront.

The course begins with a critical survey of current approaches including: early warning, conflict prevention, management, resolution and reconciliation before introducing the relatively new field of conflict transformation theory. Conflict transformation theory recognises the complexity of conflict dynamics (not having neat beginnings, middles and endings) and challenges the effectiveness of management and resolution approaches. Peace settlement and management strategies themselves have often been the source of deep resentment and justification for further violence. A transformational approach argues that protracted conflicts require more than the redistribution of material resources or reframing of positions into resolved outcomes. The approach builds upon a deeper analysis of identity of stakeholders, issues, historical grievances, structural factors and divergent world views.

Just War Theory treats war as an evil, but one that is sometimes necessary and morally defensible. So when is a state justified in resorting to military force? Traditionally, Just War theorists have maintained that only national self-defence against aggression constitutes a just cause. More recently this view has come under critical pressure. Some contemporary Just War thinkers see the traditional view as too permissive insofar as it licences the use of force – and the death and destruction attendant thereupon – in response to any breach of political sovereignty or territorial integrity. Others see the traditional paradigm as too restrictive insofar as it forbids both armed humanitarian intervention (the use of force to defend foreign nationals against a murderous or oppressive government), and preventive action to neutralise a threat in advance of its materialization (to eliminate WMDs, for instance).

Simulation may be considered as the implementation of a model over time, thereby comprising both Modelling and Simulation (M&S), or, the use of an imitation of a real system, or part thereof. M&S is a problem-based discipline that assists in the delivery of complex systems. We take a system life cycle approach to understanding M&S. Major concepts of simulation are therefore introduced from two perspectives: the perspective of the multi-disciplinary domains involved in acquiring complex systems, and, the perspective of the multi-disciplinary domains involved in system utilisation. We also introduce the issues associated with acquiring M&S systems, as distinct from other system types. Issues related to simulation management and practical usage are identified.  Systems are typically delivered through the instantiation of a project by an enterprise or business through the efforts of a number of different domains.

You will be directed to the electronic copy of these complete guidelines later in this document. ,This 6UOC research project will allow those enrolled to complete an in-depth study of a contemporary issue in Reproductive and Women’s Health which is particularly relevant to their own interest and practice.  Individual projects will vary greatly in their aims, scope and design but each should demonstrate that the student can apply the principles of research at a postgraduate level.  Examples of such projects could include:,•	The design of a small research study/ survey and collection and analysis of original data. This could encompass either qualitative and quantitative research or a combination of both ,•	Analysis of an existing database (e.g. hospital data, data available through general practice software, data available in an Assisted Conception Unit ) in order to answer a research question,•	Development and evaluation of a public health intervention in a women’s health related area,•	Evaluation of a current health/ educational program against best practice guidelines,It would be expected that the project submitted would reflect the author’s ability to: ,•	Identify and define a significant health issue in the field of reproductive or women’s health,•	Conduct a competent and comprehensive literature review, establishing what is already known on this issue and outlining the remaining questions,•	Obtain ethics approval and document informed consent of study participants if necessary ,•	Collect relevant information/ data addressing this issue,•	Analyse, interpret and present the information in the form of a cohesive project report,•	Draw conclusions from the report findings and make recommendations if applicable,The final project report should demonstrate familiarity with accepted research methodology and should be presented at a level commensurate with Master’s level academic standards. It is however important that the scope of the selected research topic is limited to one achievable within the 10,000 to 15,000 words which constitute the word limit for this major project.

At the end of the course students should be able to develop solutions to basic decision problems involving uncertainty, using specialised, free-ware software. An intuitive exposition into Bayes’ theorem is given through a number of simple-to-follow problems involving information update in light of new evidence, to show the importance of this theorem in making decisions about risk. Students learn about subjective probabilities and various formal methods of expert opinion elicitation. Two specific decision tools - Bayesian networks and Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), are examined in detail. ,Bayesian networks, which display graphically the interrelationships between variables, allow for their dependencies to be accounted for in a manner reflecting their causal relationships. This permits the evaluation of predicted consequences associated with different interventions, before these are actually implemented. MCDA allows decisions to be made when the decision-maker is faced with multiple and conflicting objectives where tradeoffs must be made, which is most often the case in the real world. Netica and SuperDecisions are free-ware software implementing Bayesian networks and MCDA, respectively, which students will use during the course to solve decision problems from a range of application fields.,Finally the course will discuss current issues in behavioural risk management and the value of first-line employees’ experience, such as their ability to identify ‘early warnings’ about risk, and what an organisation can do to encourage such employees to speak up without the fear of retribution.

(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Postgraduate,PHCM9443,6,"You may be one of those people who asks yourself ""what economics has to do with health and health care?"" For some people, economics seems quite at odds with fundamental social goals such as  'good health'. The answer lies in the fact that resources are inevitably scarce and choices have to be made about their allocation. Health economics is about the optimisation of health relative to other activities and making choices to use resources in ways that improve health and service delivery within the limited resources available. Health economics can provide insight into questions like:  Which is the more effective method of increasing the uptake of health services: price-controls or subsidies? How will the involvement of the private sector in the funding and delivery of health care affect access to it? What are the most cost-effective mechanisms for delivering essential medicines to those living in remote areas? Are out of pocket payments for health care a regressive funding mechanism? How should doctors be paid? The primary goal of this course is to provide participants with the knowledge, skills, and basic economic arguments that are central to discussions about health policy options and resource allocation choices in low and middle income countries. By the end of the course, students will be in a stronger position to (i) Demonstrate understanding of the main functions and challenges facing health systems in the developing world; (ii) explain the key economic principles and concepts relevant to health economics and financing; (iii) discuss specific features that distinguish markets for health care from markets for other goods and services; (iv) distinguish between the principal ways of funding health services and paying health care providers; and (v) critically appraise evidence on the efficiency and equity implications of health financing reforms in low and middle income countries.",Faculty of Medicine,/faculties/2018/med/med.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/PHCM9443.html,3,See Course Outline,http://www.sphcm.med.unsw.edu.au/current-students/postgraduate-coursework/course-offerings,School of Public Health and Community Medicine,http://www.sphcm.med.unsw.edu.au/,Hlth Economics & Finance for Developing Countries,http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2018/PHCM9443.html

A central theme of this course is that 21st century marketing involves consumers as participants. This changes the role of marketing communications from simply the art of persuasion to the art of conversation. And requires a strategic approach to the role of digital/social marketing and channels in the mix, a role that allows for participation with brands, provides consumers with exceptional interactive experiences, and drives their conversation with and about brands. This course will use digital marketing (including social media) management frameworks to examine how to engage in digital marketing strategically, rather than tactically, in the communications mix and will examine the need for organizations to ready themselves for a more transparent, open and collaborative relationship with their customers.,Access of the internet via mobile devices has become more prevalent than desktop assess.  Mobile marketing does not fit into the traditional marketing mindset.  The course examines how mobile represents a completely new way of thinking about marketing.  A solid understanding of the mobile marketing landscape and strategic use of the mobile marketing toolkit is crucial, including an examination of the sector’s rapid evolution and a consideration of current and future trends. Multiple case studies will be used for our examination of the key factors driving both success and failure in this new participatory world of marketing.

It is natural however that marketing practices will vary from country to country, and culture, economic and social circumstances, and societal infrastructure are different. These differences mean that a successful marketing approach in one country will not automatically work in another country. Customer preferences, competition, distribution channels and communications media differ. Global marketing requires marketers to behave in ways that are global and local at the same time by responding to similarities and differences in various markets. An important task in global marketing is learning to recognize the extent to which marketing plans and programs might be standardised worldwide as well as the extent to which they need to be adapted. The decision to enter markets outside the home country depends on a firm's resources, managerial attitudes, and the nature and extent of opportunities and threats.

(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Postgraduate,LAWS8140,6,"The purpose of this course is to provide basic financial literacy to students mainly in corporate law, but also in other fields of law. The course covers fundamentals of the operation of financial markets; theoretical concepts such as risk and return; modern developments such as derivative securities and hedge funds; and legal applications, such as damages in securities litigation. The course requires simple numerical calculations (nothing beyond addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), but the emphasis is on gaining an understanding of basic finance and its application to legal problems. This course is open only to students who have not taken a prior course in finance, or who had such a course so long ago that they need a refresher.,This course should be considered a core course for anyone considering a corporate or transactional law practice, or practically any area where economic thinking plays a role. Finance is the theory of business.  To talk to your clients; to read their documents; to draft contracts and disclosure documents for them; to counsel them on issues that mix business sense with legal constraints; you need some knowledge of finance.  Accounting is the language of business. You need that knowledge too.	,Business lawyers need to understand the business realities of the transactions that they work on.  They need to understand which contractual language gives meaningful comfort to the buyer of a business (or the seller), and which language really protects the holders of the company's bonds or other debt against opportunism by the borrowing company, which language nobody really cares very much about, and why. They need to be able to read financial statements and financial projections, to find hidden problems that may affect a deal or call for special disclosure in a prospectus or other disclosure document.  They have to find the assumptions buried in a set of projections. ,When you're working on a transaction, it's your job to find the problems and the mistakes.  When you're writing a disclosure document, you and your client are at risk if there is a material misstatement or omission. You need to understand the financial elements of the transaction to evaluate what's material and what isn't. Securities, tax and corporate lawyers also need to be able to understand the complex securities -- options, convertibles, swaps, derivatives, asset-backed securities, and many more -- that are an important part of corporate practice today.,When statutory and common law use terms such as “fair value” and “investment suitability”, an understanding of finance theory is essential to make these terms concrete and meaningful. When an injustice or some other harm occurred some time in the past, and the courts award a monetary damages award much later, our innate sense of justice suggests that the plaintiff should also be awarded interest to compensate for delayed justice. But at what interest rate? Again, finance theory comes to our rescue.,It is possible to be an adequate business lawyer without knowing anything about finance.   But I don't think it's possible, any more, for a top-flight business lawyer to be ignorant of finance.  This course can help, but students are urged to read the business press; to try to understand why a particular security is attractive to buyers; to try to understand why Company A might want to buy Company B, or divest itself of division C.,While this course is designed for business lawyers, broadly defined, it intends to cast a broad net that includes anyone who works on and cares about issues related to corporate finance. That includes corporate lawyers; tax lawyers; real estate lawyers; bankruptcy and workout lawyers.  Large chunks of this course will be useful for other types of lawyers as well.  Family lawyers and trust and estate lawyers have to know how to value assets.  If you're doing divorce work, and you aren't conversant with many of the topics in this class, you are not competent to advise your clients or negotiate good outcomes for them. The value of marital assets in divorce proceedings, such as professional goodwill and other intangibles, is an important and often litigated, but poorly understood topic.,More information can be found on the ,.",Faculty of Law,/faculties/2018/law/law.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/LAWS8140.html,2,See below,LAWS8140.html#CourseOutline,Faculty of Law,http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/,Finance for Lawyers ,http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2018/LAWS8140.html

Its ""jewel in the crown"" is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) of 1950, the world’s first and still unique human rights treaty, adopted by the Council of Europe (CoE) as a reaction to the mass atrocities of the Second World War. 47 States have ratified the Convention. Only in the year 2012 more than 65’000 applications were submitted and some 128’000 cases were pending before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Given its case load, the ECtHR has also been labelled “victim of its own success”. ,The CoE’s system for the protection of human rights will be in the central focus of this course. The course provides a general introduction to its history, institutions and instruments. It will discuss the changing views about the tasks of the ECtHR and analyse prospects and reform of the system. In addition, the course will examine ""absolute"" guarantees (right to life, prohibition of torture), the freedoms of expression and of the press, multiculturalism/minority rights protection, and democracy/the right to free elections. It will also deal with social rights protection, a particularly burning issue in times of financial crisis. ,Likewise other important actors besides the CoE in the field of human rights in Europe will be dealt with, namely the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU) which have become an important actors in the field of human rights. Questions of complementarity, overlap and “rivalry” between these organisations will be discussed. Finally the course will briefly compare the European system to other regional systems of human rights protection, namely the Inter-American and the African ones.,This course will be of interest to students with an interest in human rights law and how it applies in the regional context of Europe.

The industrial revolution precipitated the mass movement of populations from rural to urban areas, presenting governments and communities with the challenge of fitting large numbers of people on limited land without compromising safety, health and happiness.,This course will look at urbanisation as a global, national and local phenomenon.  We will range from Mumbai slums to Hong Kong towers, recycled waterfronts to eco-communes.  We will explore the development of Sydney and its planned trajectory, studying significant urban regeneration sites like Ultimo and Pyrmont, as well as greenfields developments on the urban fringe. We will consider the advantages and disadvantages of high density urban living vs low density suburban life. We will examine the role of private property law, particularly strata and community title, in constructing the built environment and then managing the people and communities who live there.  For example, should private property law be used not only to mandate what people build on their own land, but how they behave or even dress? Can ""community"" be created in new housing developments or must it develop organically? Should large tracts of bushland or waterfronts, roads, parks or sewerage treatment facilities be privatised or should they remain public assets? We will look at groups of people who have opted out of the city, setting up alternative communes or “utopias” in rural areas with community title legislation.  What is the motivation for these communities and do they work? Students will be introduced to sociological, legal and planning research, as well as studying the real-world application of those theories.  Topics include urban planning; Sydney city and its suburbs; large-scale commercial and residential high rise; master planned, eco and gated communities; child-friendly cities; metropolises of Asia; and urban regeneration.

It examines the following question: What does the concept ""biology"" do in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as ""nature"", ""bodies"", ""organism"", ""groups"" or ""life"" (to name just a few). ""Theories of Law and Biology"" aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.,The unit complements other units offered at the law school such as “Legal Theory”, “Law and Social Theory”, and “Theories of Law and Justice”. Similar to these units, “Theories of Law and Biology” emphasizes the theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to courses such as “Law and Medical Health” or “Intellectual Property Law” which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that “Theories of Law and Biology” takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that this unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method of thinking and understanding. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system. ,Students wishing to think about law “outside the box"" and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course.

Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors - are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.,Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed.  It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all. ,Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.,In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – , as a dominant approach to understanding law and , as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legal positivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.,Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.,In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain ‘problems’ of contemporary legal practice. A consideration of the materials for the later classes will show the type of issues that will be discussed:  the character of public law (ideas associated with constitutionalism and rule of law), relativism and ‘western’ human rights, and the feminist and postmodern/post-structural challenges to understanding law.,You may have dealt with the present law on some of these matters in other law courses. Here we are interested in what philosophy has to say about these problems.,(a)What kind of beings are we – the legal, moral, liberal subject? Not an ontological question (as to what we are really like) but a question about what is significant about us from the legal, moral, political perspectives.,(b) Role of (practical) reason. How can our laws and our institutions be rational, be justified to free thinking? The character of legal, moral, and political reasoning: including, similarities – between proof and scepticism i.e. inter-subjective character; differences – law a special case (as authority, autonomy...), right/good, instrumental reasoning/value reasoning...,(c) In the background are larger questions of method in social/ethical/legal theory - the proper way to see the division of normative and factual issues. For example, what is the relationship between the cultural understandings of (a) above and what we are really like (for instance, human nature)? And what is the relationship between what is rational to us in Australia now and what is rational in a larger sense (for instance, are human rights universal?) How can we be both inside and outside of our practices?,More information can be found on the ,.",Faculty of Law,/faculties/2018/law/law.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/JURD7431.html,4,See below,JURD7431.html#CourseOutline,Faculty of Law,http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/,Legal Theory ,http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2018/JURD7431.html

Feminist analyses of law provide some of the most significant and challenging explanatory frameworks for understanding the practice and organisation of laws and legal institutions. These insights and frameworks focus on concepts such as the public/private divide, equality and intersectional discrimination, representation and power.

We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice?

(more info),/general/2018/SSAPO/EFTSL.html,Sydney,Postgraduate,JURD7223,6,"This course encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory. The course is theoretical in the following sense. In their practical, day-to-day, activities, lawyers take, and must take, much for granted: about the nature of the law, about the purposes and functions of its institutions and doctrines, and about the worth of it all. They practise within established legal systems, with more or less settled,institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Customarily they think within the categories and arrangements provided by the legal system, rather than about them.,Legal Theory is concerned to think about precisely those frameworks that lawyers think within. It aims to probe and discuss theoretical questions about law, which underlie the practical stuff of the law. Such questions include matters of description and analysis - what's going on?; of comparison - what else goes on elsewhere and what can it tell us about what goes on here? - and of evaluation - is what is going on what should be going on? Purported answers to such questions are constantly assumed and relied upon in legal talk and action. Legal actors, however - like all social actors -,are frequently unaware of the extent to which, or the ways in which, what they take to be perfectly obvious, natural and impossible to imagine otherwise reflects particular, usually traditional assumptions which are questionable but are rarely questioned.,Legal theory examines such assumptions, clarifies the issues with which they are concerned and frequently shows these issues to be more puzzling and contentious than is commonly assumed. It acquaints students with, and gives them opportunities to think about, question, criticise and defend, some of the most important ingredients in their own thought about the law; ingredients which are all the more important for not being commonly recognised as matters of argument or even discussion at all.,Theoretical inquiry has no predetermined 'results', or rather just one. Students will decide for themselves whether they emerge from such inquiry with better or worse reasons to believe what they started with, or whether they should believe new or different things. On the other hand, however they begin, they are unlikely to emerge thinking that the questions discussed in the course have simple, obvious or uncontroversial answers.,In general terms this course discusses the consequences for law of the present ascendancy of two basic ideas – legal positivism as a dominant approach to understanding law and liberalism as an organising framework for thinking about political life. Legal positivism, basically, is the idea that the validity of law is a matter that can be worked out independently of non-legal (e.g. moral) concerns. A liberal understanding of politics among other things takes the conception of ourselves as self-governing (as autonomous) as its basic value and evaluates legal practices in terms of how well or badly they,contribute to this value. Time is spent discussing these accounts of law and politics.,Along the way we discuss a number of basic ideas associated with contemporary legal/moral/political philosophy. These include - the nature of legal analysis, the separation of law from other areas of social life, the difference in moral theory between the right and the good, moral and personal autonomy, liberalism’s relationship to rights and to cultural and religious difference, and law’s relationship to justice, democracy and the rule of law.,In order to make these ideas more concrete we relate them to certain ‘problems’ of contemporary legal practice. A consideration of the materials for the later classes will show the type of issues that will be discussed: the character of public law (ideas associated with constitutionalism and rule of law), relativism and ‘western’ human rights, and the feminist and postmodern/post-structural challenges to understanding law.,You may have dealt with the present law on some of these matters in other law courses. Here we are interested in what philosophy has to say about these problems.,(a)What kind of beings are we – the legal, moral, liberal subject? Not an ontological question (as to what we are really like) but a question about what is significant about us from the legal, moral, political perspectives.,(b) Role of (practical) reason. How can our laws and our institutions be rational, be justified to free thinking? The character of legal, moral, and political reasoning: including, similarities – between proof and scepticism i.e. inter-subjective character; differences – law a special case (as authority, autonomy...), right/good, instrumental reasoning/value reasoning...,(c) In the background are larger questions of method in social/ethical/legal theory - the proper way to see the division of normative and factual issues. For example, what is the relationship between the cultural understandings of (a) above and what we are really like (for instance, human nature)? And what is the relationship between what is rational to us in Australia now and what is rational in a larger sense (for instance, are human rights universal?) How can we be both inside,and outside of our practices?,More information can be found on the ,.",Faculty of Law,/faculties/2018/law/law.html,See Tuition Fee Schedule,https://student.unsw.edu.au/fees-to-pay,See Class Timetable,http://www.timetable.unsw.edu.au/2018/JURD7223.html,4,See below,JURD7223.html#CourseOutline,Faculty of Law,http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/,Legal Theory ,http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2018/JURD7223.html

A business process is a set of activities that jointly realise a business goal in an organisational and technical environment. These processes take place in a single organisation but may need to interact with processes in other organizations. Business process management (BPM) is concerned with the concepts, methods, and techniques that support the design, administration, configuration, enactment, and analysis of business processes. BPM is concerned with the explicit representation of processes – once they are defined, processes can be analysed, improved, and enacted. Software in the form of business process management systems can be used to coordinate business process activities.,By taking this course you will be able to understand business process from a general management perspective, and learn tools, analytical frameworks and general principles for managing business processes.

It differs from asset pricing theory in which prices are assumed to be set such that supply and demand are equated via some costless auction-type frictionless mechanism that remains an undisclosed ‘black box’.  Actual markets require actual rules and these rules affect the way in which prices are established, the way in which information possessed by traders is incorporated into asset prices, why some markets and stocks are liquid and why some markets are more fragile and costly than others.  A few years ago, brokers were collectively able to set high minimum fees, exceedingly high minimum spreads (transaction costs reflecting the minimum tick size), monopoly provision of limit-order placement by the ‘specialist’, prohibition on the entry of alternative exchange mechanisms and numerous other anti-competitive practices designed to protect stockbroker incomes. ,Major markets such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) remained unable to open for hours during crisis periods such as occurred in 1987.  In part due to the huge growth in both market microstructure theory and empirical work in recent years, stock markets have become far more competitive in recent years but many remain opaque and it is far from clear that pricing efficiency has improved.  This course provides the necessary theoretical insights to comprehend the nature of these radical changes and to understand the direction that both competition and design rule changes are taking global exchange activities for stocks and other financial instruments.,All wealth creation requires an understanding of how asset prices are actually set, how investors can draw on their assets (wealth) when needed, i.e., their liquidity, and at what cost.  Should investors delegate choice of their portfolios for their retirement to others or should they become active traders themselves?  If so, how and where should they trade?

First, three problems which areas based local on a no-arbitrage condition will be discussed: option pricing, structural models of credit risk, and the trade - off theory of the optimal capital structure. Second, portfolio theory and the characterization of expected asset returns in equilibrium will be analysed. These two problems were the first applications of the continuous-time finance approach.

Financial development has drastically increased the borrowing and savings opportunities of households, firms have now wider investment opportunities, and financial integration has drastically changed the growth patterns in East Asia and China. However, there is also an increasing awareness that because of financial integration and development, agents and economies’ performances are now deeply interlinked and subject to greater economic volatility than in the past.,The rapid development of financial markets and the role that they play in our economies call for an exploration of the links between the financial and the economic spheres. In the first part, this subject will provide the basis for an exploration of how financial markets impact upon the macroeconomic environment and its “real” outcomes. Historical, international and development perspectives will be considered. The second part explores the functioning of financial markets and how they shape behaviours, constraints and opportunities for firms and households alike.

Social entrepreneurs are often defined as leaders who use business processes - including technological innovation, entrepreneurial skills and market distributive mechanisms - to address unmet social needs and create positive social outcomes. Social intrapreneurs are individuals who pursue social or environmental objectives from within a company. Building on the knowledge and skills developed in MGMT5710 Managing and Leading People, this course aims to equip social entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs more specifically with the skills for leading positive social change, which include leadership, mindfulness and creativity, communication, and conflict resolution so that they might successfully influence key decision-makers, build networks and make their ideas a reality. Students will also be taught an awareness of change processes and an understanding of ethics and human rights to lead sustainable change, locally and globally.

As a critical part of the design process the model expresses ideas and concepts in three dimensions with concern for materials, lighting, space and, nowadays, interactivity; in other words the model literally presents all of the components of a finished architecture. Traditionally architectural models have been hand-made which both reflected the building process of the time and a cultural longing by architects to be more directly involved in the production of their work (many architects design products, especially furniture, for the same reason). But for some time now architecture has been tending towards the assembly of factory made components; and, as can be seen across the world, factories tend towards automated machine-made production. It’s worthwhile to point out at this stage that beautiful things are created in factories. Porsche, Honda, Apple, Prada and Boeing (to name a few) all use factories to create amazingly sophisticated products; most for a fraction of the cost of the average architect designed building.   ,If architectural models should reflect both the finished architecture and its mode of production they will need to employ automated processes such as digital modelling, laser cutting, CNC milling and rapid prototyping. However, this elective isn’t dogmatic; several hand-made processes will also be employed (hot-wire cutting blue foam, casting, sheet metal folding). In this elective students will be trained to use and have direct access to all of these machines.,In this elective students will select 3 from the number of techniques on offer to fabricate components that have precedents in architecture relating to the students design studio.

As an artist or designer you are expected to write formal components to accompany your work, such as concept presentation, artist statements, grant proposals or reflective journals. Instead of being a stumbling block, writing can become an important tool for professional development in your creative or visual practice. ,This fully online course will help you to write about your own work in a more professional and effective manner. Using less formal, creative writing methods, you will learn to develop discipline-based vocabularies, which are more appropriate and meaningful to you and your practice. During this course you will investigate writing tools and methods used by studio practitioners; develop your own set of tools and writing strategies; then apply these to a professional scenario. By the end of this course, you should be able to more clearly articulate and contextualise your work in the marketplace and your professional community in your own words. ,You will also explore how writing can become a more integral part of the conceptual development process. You will participate in activities designed to clarify and refine your existing ideas, and to evolve ideas that you may have not realised were even there.
