new feature:
1.  need a sub program to extract program code.
	the way of extract course id is import re to compile [^[a-z]*4[0-9]*4$]  >>> course_id 
	then if compile[^[0-9]*4$] >>> program id
	we can decide which format we use according whether we got the id or not.

2.  different operration for different tables.
there are 6 tables in the db, which are  
| course_desp     |
| course_info     |
| degree_info     |
| faculty         |
| school          |
| student_support |

(1) student_support
if not program id && not course id:
 the response will like this :
|  Here is the infomation about Moodle login :ss:{SELECT discription,url FROM student_support WHERE service = 'Moodle login';} |
you can split the string by : and get ss (student_support)
the sql query inside the {} will return the information user need.

(2). faculty and school :
 no need , pass

(3) course_desp & course_info & degree_info:
(course id && !program id)
1.if the response is nothing(not matched) , return all the informathion the course had.

if (response == 'I am sorry, but that does not look like anything to me.'):
	if course id && !program id:
		re,cursor = query('SELECT * FROM course_desp,course_info WHERE course_code = course_id;',cursor)
		return re
	if program id && !course id:
		re,cursor = query('SELECT * FROM cdegree_info WHERE program = program_id;',cursor)
		return re
elif(response == 'infomation about{course_id/program id}:cp:{sql}'):
	change {course_id/program id} to the actual id
	if course id && !program id:
		sql = 'SELECT * FROM course_desp,course_info WHERE course_code = course_id;'
		re,cursor = query(sql,cursor)
	if !course id && program id:
		sql = ''SELECT * FROM cdegree_info WHERE program = program_id;'
		re,cursor = query(sql,cursor)
	if !course id && !program id:
		return 'I am sorry, but that does not look like anything to me.'

3. I upload new corpus you can get it from github and train the cb to see the performance.
  you need to build a sql on ur labtop, in case you dont have it. here is the steps.
  (1) down load mysql from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
  (2) set the Environmental variable
  (3) edit my-default.ini

like this 
	basedir=D:\Program Files\JavaTool\MySQL\mysql-5.6.39-winx64

	datadir=D:\Program Files\JavaTool\MySQL\mysql-5.6.39-winx64\data


  (4) install mysql using instruction
  (5) start sql server.
  (6) import sql file(on github dir chatbot database)
  (7) run py file import csv file in .
    (2 py files in chatbot_spider & map_spider)

4. I prepare the code for sqlquery for you also on github.
5. I will stay up late for tomorrow , if you got any questions just let me know and lets figure it out.
