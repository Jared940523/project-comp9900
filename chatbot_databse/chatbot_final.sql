Theoretical courses cover the theories that can be directly applied to inform and improve practice. The results of the latest research form an integral part of the content of the program\'s courses. The practical courses apply the learning from the theoretical courses to the development of bilingual interpreting skills. In addition to the knowledge and skills of interpreting as a discipline and as a profession, you will also learn related academic and practical skills such as critical analysis, independent research and preparation, project management, team work, and genres and public speaking - which are all related to the work of interpreters. You will also learn about the different settings in which interpreters work, such as law, health, business and international relations. Teaching methods match the objectives of the program by combining lectures with practical tutorials and a variety of exercises where students actively participate. You will be assessed through different tasks that target the varied skills and knowledge the courses aim to develop; these include tasks such as: simulated interpreted interactions, virtual translation projects, critical self-analysis of students\' own performance, research projects and theoretical papers.The program has a strong linguistic component which underpins the theoretical basis of the process and practice of interpreting. Course content addresses the most pressing areas of interpreting, legal, medical, business, community and conference interpreting. It also offers a wide variety of language combinations not available at other institutions. The program combines theoretical lectures delivered in English with language-specific practical tutorials where the theories learned in the lectures are applied to the practice.

Due to the diverse nature of the disciplines within the program, details of acceptable disciplines considered for admission are shown in relevant plan pages in the Handbook. A \'good pass\' is considered to be a weighted average mark of 55-64. However, particular disciplines within Science may have additional entry requirements due to the competitive nature of some disciplines and the number of research places available within a School.Applicants with substantial professional experience which demonstrates an aptitude for research or significant understanding in a discipline area, will be considered for admission.

In terms of the law, established doctrines including defamation and privacy are being used in new ways to cope with the regulatory impact of this increased reliance on the digital sphere.

Students will have the opportunity to learn how to communicate via a series of media, whether in print, broadcasting or online. In turn, students will supplement these practical skills by developing an understanding of the regulatory context in which those skills can be used.

The program includes three BE select electives which will facilitate a focus on specific urban policy issues.The program is run over three semesters (Semester 1, Semester 2 and Summer Term). The program can be taken full-time or part-time.  Courses in the program will be delivered in intensive teaching blocks in order to enable those working full-time and interstate to participate.  Students can undertake a Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma or a full Masters degree.The program will utilise a number of different teaching strategies including: studios, master classes, problem-based learning, case studies and field trips, consulting projects with clients, and evidence-based research.  An international research studio is offered to Diploma and Masters students. Class sizes in the program will deliberately be small to allow students to engage in highly interactive classes with other students, researchers, professionals, adjunct faculty and teachers.\nAdmission Requirements\nIn order to apply to the program applicants must have at least 3 years of post graduate, industry experience, including work in an urban, regional or related professional role. An undergraduate degree with at  least a credit average in a relevant discipline is also required.  A relevant degree would encompass studies in a built environment discipline as well as studies in social science, social policy, business and law. Local and international students are eligible to apply. The program is particularly suited to professionals wanting to up skill after being in the field for several years.  As part of their application for entry into the program applicants will be required to undertake a brief interview with the Discipline Director.

Therefore, students who intend to complete a double major should be aware that it may involve extra time and cost to complete, and may have visa implications for international students.\nHonours\nWhere students successfully complete a total of 144 UoC and all the requirements of the first three years of the program, including Level 1/2/3, major, and General Education requirements, they apply for a supervisor and project through a nominated Science School for progress to the fourth -year honours component. A WAM of 70 in courses at Stage 1 to 3 in a student\'s major leading to Honours is required for progression to Stage 4. There are two exceptions to this requirement. For students planning to undertake Honours in Psychology, a WAM of 75 in PSYC courses in the student\'s major is required. For students planning Honours in any disciplines in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, a WAM of 70 in Level 3 courses taken for the major is also required. Students whose results do not meet these requirements may still be admitted to Honours subject to supervision and resources being available, and at the discretion of the Head of School. If a student is not permitted to progress to Stage 4 in Advanced Science (Honours) they will be required to transfer to, and graduate from, program 3970 Bachelor of Science. Students should be aware that not all Advanced Science (Honours) majors are available in program 3970, meaning that graduation in 3970 may occur in a less specialised major. Entry to Honours may still be possible by application to enter program 4500 Bachelor of Science (Honours). Students should seek the guidance of the appropriate School at an early stage of study to ensure that the study stream being followed is best suited to lead to Honours. Applications for admission into Honours should be made with the relevant School. An Honours year includes an independent research project under the guidance of an academic supervisor culminating in a written thesis, and may include higher-level coursework, compulsory attendance at OH&S training, writing literature reviews and research proposals, attending workshops and lectures, and attending and presenting seminars. The Honours year normally commences in Semester 1 and is undertaken full-time over 1 year. The independent research project will usually be worth 18-48 UOC undertaken across the entire year. For details of the admission requirements, structure and assessment of Honours for a particular discipline, please refer to the plan pages below. Honours is available in the following areas:\n\nAnatomy\nApplied Mathematics\nBioinformatics\nBiology\nBiotechnology\nChemistry\nClimate Science\nEcology\nGenetics\nGeography\nGeology\nMarine Science\nMaterials Science\nMicrobiology\nMolecular and Cell Biology\nNeuroscience\nPalaeoscience\nPathology\nPharmacology\nPhysical Oceanography\nPhysics\nPhysiology\nPsychology\nPure Mathematics\nStatistics\nVision Science\n\nStudents completing Honours will be considered for the award of Honours according to the following scale (based on performance in Stage 4 and the calculation described in the particular discipline area):\n\nHonours Class 1: mark or weighted average of 85 or greater\nHonours Class 2 Division 1: mark or weighted average from 75 to 84\nHonours Class 2 Division 2: mark or weighted average from 65 to 74\nHonours Class 3 or Pass: mark or weighted average below 65\n\nStudents enrolled in the Advanced Science (Honours) program who wish to take out the Bachelor of Science award at pass level without proceeding to Honours, are required to transfer to the Science program (3970). Applications to transfer should be lodged with the Science Student Centre no later than the census date for the semester in which the student expects to satisfy requirements.

Please refer to the streams in the Handbook for details.\nMinor StreamsAll home-based and \"external\" majors (see below) are available to be completed as a minor stream (\"Non-designated Minor\"). There are, however, some areas of study that are only available as minors.  These are known as \"Designated Minors\".  The Designated Minors for the Bachelor of Arts are:\n     \n    \n      \n        \n          Art History and Theory(UNSW Art & Design)\n          Arts and Social Sciences\n          Australian Studies\n          Indonesian Studies\n          Italian Studies\n        \n        \n          \n            Mathematics for Engineers\n            (UNSW Science)\n          \n          Modern Greek Studies\n          \n            Psychology\n            (UNSW Science)\n          \n          Women\'s and Gender Studies\n        \n      \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        \n           External minor streams are designated with grey boxes\n        \n      \n    \n  \nExternal Minor Stream and Dual Award ProgramsIf you are enrolled in a dual award program, you cannot complete a minor stream in the same Faculty as your second program of study.  For example if you are enrolled in the BA/BCom, you cannot complete an external minor in Economics.You will not be able to take external minors that are any greater than 24 UOC unless you take extra UOC over 96 UOC to meet the external stream requirements. This affects the external minors in Human Resource Management (30 UOC), International Business (30 UOC), Economics (30 UOC), Geography (36 UOC), and Psychology (36 UOC).\nMathematics for EngineersThis minor is only available if you are completing the Bachelor of Arts in dual mode with designated programs offered by the Faculty of Engineering. Of the courses completed in this minor stream, 24 UOC are shared with the relevant Engineering program.\nMedicine Students and the Arts and Social Sciences MinorIf you complete study in this program in dual mode with the Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery, you will be required to design your Independent Learning Project (ILP) as a joint project with the Bachelor of Arts. For you, 12 UOC of the 30 UOC that makes up the ILP will be double counted towards the Arts and Social Sciences minor in the Bachelor of Arts. The remaining 12 UOC will be made up of two courses offered within Arts and Social Sciences that relate to the ILP project; this must be approved by the Convenor of the Bachelor of Arts. This 12 UOC may include courses shared from the major stream in the BA you are already completing.  If you wish to do this, you will need to make up your requirements for the BA with Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives. If you do not want to pursue this option but want to complete another Bachelor of Arts minor stream you can do so. This will mean that you will need to do additional units of credit to meet the requirements of the program.\nLanguage Studies for Commencing Mid-Year StudentsIf your language skills are assessed as Level A in Introductory, Intermediate, Advanced or Professional you cannot commence study until Semester 1.\nDouble Major Stream and External Major StreamsIf you are enrolled in the single degree, you can use your free electives and general education to upgrade your required minor stream to a major stream and graduate with a double major. This second major stream can be taken from within Arts and Social Sciences or from a list of approved \"External Majors\" offered in the BA from outside of Arts and Social Sciences. The General Education requirement is met if you complete an external major or minor (for example, Economics).\n     \n    \n      \n        \n          Human Resource Management(48 UOC) UNSW Business School\n          International Business(48 UOC) UNSW Business School\n          Economics(60 UOC) UNSW Business School\n          Geographical Studies(60 UOC) UNSW Science\n          Studies in Psychology(60 UOC) UNSW Science\n        \n      \n    \n  \nGeography exemption in BA/BEd (Secondary)If you complete the dual award program BA/BEd (Secondary) you can get an exemption from the Home-based major rule if you wish to complete Geography as your first teaching method. If you seek this exemption you must complete a minor from within Arts and Social Sciences.NOTE: For details of individual major and minor streams please consult the relevant stream entries in the Handbook.\nExtended Minor StreamsThe extended minor streams are only available to BA/BEd and BSci (Intl) students.\n    \n      \n        \n          Chinese Studies\n          English*\n          French Studies\n          German Studies\n        \n        \n          History*\n          Indigenous Studies*\n          Indonesian Studies\n          Japanese Studies\n        \n        \n          Korean Studies\n          Legal Studies*\n          Linguistics*\n          Politics*\n        \n        \n          Sociology & Anthropology*\n          Spanish & Latin American Studies\n          Theatre & Performance Studies*\n        \n      \n    \n  \n*Extended Minors only available to BA/BEd studentsThese extended minors are only available if you are completing the Bachelor of Arts in dual mode with the Bachelor of Education.\nUNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed ElectivesUNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives are any courses chosen from the offerings of UNSW Arts and Social Sciences. You can use these courses to add depth to your major or minor stream (above the minimum requirements) or undertake other courses from other areas of study within UNSW Arts and Social Sciences. Indigenous Studies courses (ATSIxxxx) cannot be studied as UNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives.\nFree ElectivesA Free Elective is any course offered either within or outside UNSW Arts and Social Sciences into which you can enrol.\nARTS2050 Academic Writing for the Humanities (6 UOC)HUMS1005 Personalised English Language Enhancement (6 UOC)\nThese courses, ARTS2050 and HUMS1005, can be counted as UNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives or Free Electives.\nGeneral EducationGeneral Education requires you to complete 12 UOC (two courses) offered outside UNSW Arts and Social Sciences. This requirement is met if you complete an external major or minor (for example, Economics). Indigenous Studies courses (ATSIxxxx) can be studied as General Education only if you are not following a major or minor in Indigenous Studies within the BA program.\nAward with DistinctionYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.\nHonoursOnce you have completed your Bachelor of Arts (in either Single or Dual mode) you can apply for admission to do an Honours year in the Bachelor of Arts and Social Sciences (Honours) program 4504.

The Designated Minors for the Bachelor of Arts are:\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Art History and Theory (UNSW Art & Design) \n          \n          \n            Arts and Social Sciences***\n          \n          \n            Australian Studies\n          \n          \n            Greek Studies\n          \n          \n            Indonesian Studies\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Italian Studies\n          \n          \n            Legal Studies*\n          \n          \n            Mathematics**\n            (UNSW Science)\n          \n          Women\'s and Gender Studies\n        \n      \n    \n     \n    \n      \n        \n           External minor streams are designated with grey boxes\n        \n      \n    \n     \n  \n*Legal StudiesThis minor is only available to students completing the Bachelor of Arts in Dual mode with the Bachelor of Education and who are wishing to pursue a teaching method in this area.** MathematicsThis minor is only available to students completing the dual degree program 3763 Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)/Bachelor of Arts. 24 UOC of courses completed in this minor stream are shared with the Engineering program.*** Medicine Students and the Arts and Social Sciences MinorStudents completing study in this program in Dual mode with the Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery will be required to design their Independent Learning Project (ILP) as a joint project with the Bachelor of Arts.  Twenty four UOC of the 30 UOC that makes up the ILP will be double counted towards the Arts and Social Sciences Minor in the Bachelor of Arts.  The remaining 12 UOC will be made up of two courses in UNSW Arts and Social Sciences that relate to the ILP project, approved by the Convenor of the Bachelor of Arts.  This 12 UOC may be courses shared from the major stream in the BA the student is already completing.  If such is the case the student will make up their depth requirement for the BA with UNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives.  Students who do not wish to pursue this option but complete another BA minor stream will be able to do so. This will result in an extra semester of study to meet the requirements of the program.\nLanguage Studies for Commencing Mid-Year StudentsIf your language skills are assessed as Level A in Introductory, Intermediate, Advanced or Professional you cannot commence study until Semester 1.\nExternal minor streams and UNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Elective Requirement\nEconomics, Human Resource Management and International Business: students completing these minor streams (30 UOC) are required to complete an additional 6 UOC UNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Elective.\nExternal Minor Stream and Dual Award Programs\nStudents enrolled in Dual award programs are not permitted to complete a minor stream in the same Faculty as their second program of study. For example a student enrolled in the BCom/BA cannot complete an external minor in Economics.\nDouble Major Stream and External Major Streams\nStudents can complete a \"Double Major\" in the BA if they use the space from their free electives to upgrade their required Minor Stream to a Major Stream. This second Major Stream can be taken from within the Faculty or from the list of approved \"External Majors\". External Majors are Streams of study offered by other Faculties.\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            Human Resource Management (48 UOC)\n            (UNSW Business School)\n          \n          \n            International Business (48 UOC)\n            (UNSW Business School) \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Economics (60 UOC)\n            (UNSW Business School)\n          \n          \n            Geography (60 UOC)\n            (UNSW Science)\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Psychology (78 UOC)\n            (UNSW Science)\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \nPsychology External Major StreamStudents seeking to complete an external major in Psychology are required to complete a fourth Psychology course (PSYC2101 Assessment and Personality and Psychopathology) at level 1.\nGeography exemption in BA/BEd (Secondary)Students completing the dual award program BA/BEd (Secondary) can secure an exemption from the Home-based Major rule and the UNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Elective rule if they wish to complete Geography as their first teaching method.Students who seek this exemption must complete a home-based minor.NOTE: For details of individual major and minor stream please consult the relevant stream entries.\nSample Programs\nSee \"Sample Programs\" below.\nUNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives\nUNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives are any courses chosen from the offerings of UNSW Arts and Social Sciences. Students can add depth to their major or minor stream (above the minimum requirements) or undertake other courses from other areas of study within UNSW Arts and Social Sciences. Indigenous Studies courses (ATSIxxxx) cannot be studied as UNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives.\nFree Electives\nA Free Elective is any course offered either within or outside UNSW Arts and Social Sciences in which the student is able to enrol.\nARTS2050 Academic Writing for the Humanities (6 UOC)HUMS1005 Personalised English Language Enhancement (6 UOC)\nThese courses, ARTS2050 and HUMS1005, can be counted as UNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives or Free Electives.\nGeneral Education\nGeneral Education is the completion of two courses (12 UOC) offered outside UNSW Arts and Social Sciences. This requirement is met if an external major or minor (for example, Economics) is completed. Indigenous Studies courses (ATSIxxxx) can be studied as General Education only if students are not following a major or minor in Indigenous Studies within the BA program.\nAward with Distinction\nYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.\nHonours\nHigh achieving Bachelor of Arts students (in Single or Dual mode)  who have successfully completed all program requirements may apply for admission to honours in the Bachelor of Arts and Social Sciences (Honours) program 4504.

It is expected that all applicants will have a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Standard English, English as a Second Language or Advanced English, or an overall IELTS score of 7.5, with a minimum of 8.0 in Speaking and Listening and a minimum of 7.0 in Reading and Writing, or the equivalent.\nProficiency in Languages other than English \nStudents undertaking a major or minor in a language other than English as a first or second teaching specialisation may be asked to take an additional assessment of their language skills before being permitted to enrol in their specific language teaching specialisation (i.e., method).  This is to ensure they have the necessary language competence, including in both spoken and written language, to teach the target language to HSC level in NSW schools.\nParticipation and Enrolment RequirementsFor accreditation as a teacher in NSW, all teacher education students will need to meet the following participation and enrolment requirements set by the NSW Educations Standards Authority (NESA).\nAssessment of Suitability for TeachingIt is a NESA requirement that all UNSW Bachelor of Education students successfully complete a full year (48 UOC) of studies in their specific disciplinary content area (e.g., Maths, Science, Economics, Arts, etc.) before undertaking any discipline-specific curriculum and pedagogic studies (Methods) or professional experience placements in schools. At the end of their first semester they must also complete a motivational statement as to why they want to be a teacher, which is scored on a 2-point scale: No – incoherent, irrelevant, or inappropriate reasons, or Yes - coherent and valid reason. If students score ‘No’, they will be counselled out of the program. In addition, before their first supervised professional experience placement, all teacher education students must successfully complete:\n\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education.\nThe Classroom Readiness Questionnaire. The Classroom Readiness Questionnaire is a pre-professional experience self-assessment tool that requires students to provide evidence of success across six areas (subject content, inherent requirements, professional language/literacy/numeracy, oral communication, classroom management, and commitment to the profession). Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nProficiency in Languages Other than English Teacher education students undertaking a major or extended minor stream in a language other than English (e.g., Chinese) as a first or second teaching specialisation may be asked to take an additional assessment of their language other than English skills before being permitted to enrol in the relevant language teaching specialisation (i.e., Method). This is to ensure that they have the necessary language competence, including both spoken and written language, to teach the target language at HSC level in NSW schools.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years. This is the only training that will be accepted by the DoE to meet the requirement of anaphylaxis training for initial Teacher Education Students.\nAward with Distinction\nYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.\nHonours\nAfter completion of 144 UOC including all of the requirements of the  Bachelor of Education (Secondary) dual degree, high achieving students may apply for admission to the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509.

Prospective teachers must be able to communicate effectively with school students and staff members.  It is expected that all applicants will have a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Standard English or a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in English as a Second Language or a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Advanced English or an overall IELTS score of 7.5, with a minimum of 8.0 in speaking and Listening and a minimum of 7.0 in reading and writing or the equivalent.\nProficiency in Languages other than EnglishIf you are undertaking a major or extended minor stream in a language other than English as a first or second teaching specialisation, you may be asked to take an additional assessment of your language skills before being permitted to enrol in your specific language teaching specialisation (i.e., method).  This is to ensure that you have the necessary language competence, including both spoken and written language, to teach the target language at HSC level in NSW schools.\nParticipation and Enrolment RequirementsFor accreditation as a teacher in NSW, all teacher education students will need to meet the following participation and enrolment requirements set by the NSW Educations Standards Authority (NESA).\nAssessment of Suitability for TeachingIt is a NESA requirement that all UNSW Bachelor of Education students successfully complete a full year (48 UOC) of studies in their specific disciplinary content area (e.g., Maths, Science, Economics, Arts, etc.) before undertaking any discipline-specific curriculum and pedagogic studies (Methods) or professional experience placements in schools. At the end of their first semester they must also complete a motivational statement as to why they want to be a teacher, which is scored on a 2-point scale: No – incoherent, irrelevant, or inappropriate reasons, or Yes - coherent and valid reason. If students score ‘No’, they will be counselled out of the program. In addition, before their first supervised professional experience placement, all teacher education students must successfully complete:\n\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education.\nThe Classroom Readiness Questionnaire. The Classroom Readiness Questionnaire is a pre-professional experience self-assessment tool that requires students to provide evidence of success across six areas (subject content, inherent requirements, professional language/literacy/numeracy, oral communication, classroom management, and commitment to the profession). Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nProficiency in Languages Other than English Teacher education students undertaking a major or extended minor stream in a language other than English (e.g., Chinese) as a first or second teaching specialisation may be asked to take an additional assessment of their language other than English skills before being permitted to enrol in the relevant language teaching specialisation (i.e., Method). This is to ensure that they have the necessary language competence, including both spoken and written language, to teach the target language at HSC level in NSW schools.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years. This is the only training that will be accepted by the DoE to meet the requirement of anaphylaxis training for initial Teacher Education Students.\nAward with DistinctionYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.\nHonoursOnce you have completed your Bachelor of Education in Dual mode and 144 UOC overall you can apply for admission to do an Honours year in the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509.

The School of Aviation offers Honours in both full-time and part-time modes through the science faculty in stream AVIAAH of Program 4500 Bachelor of Science (Honours).   Typically students require a minimum overall WAM (weighted average mark) of a credit (65% minimum) for entry into honours, although due to the competitive nature of honours, the level of academic performance required may be higher in some years. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to, a credit, the School of Aviation may take into consideration a student\'s academic performance in aviation courses when assessing an application for honours. Students seeking to enrol in honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) (including all level I, core courses, and general education requirements).  Students who have not qualified for the Bachelor of Aviation (Flying) at pass level will not be permitted to enrol in honours. Admission requirements, as well as the number of places available, are determined by the Head of School or nominee.Students who are granted admission into Honours after completion of the requirements for the Bachelor of Aviation, will graduate from the Bachelor of Aviation at the end of the three years, and will then apply for entry to the Science Honours Program 4500, Stream AVIAAH.Students may enrol in Honours on a part-time or full-time basis.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nStudents in this program must satisfy the University\'s General Education requirements.

Students are expected to take lower stage courses in preference to higher stage courses in order to complete lower stage program requirements as soon as possible.\nDual Awards\nWhen students take Aviation (Management) in combination with another degree as a dual award, 96 UOC of discipline specific core must be completed as follows:\n\n78 UOC of core Aviation courses as described above\n18 UOC of Aviation Management electives (12 UOC at Stage 2 and 6UOC at Stage 3)\n\nWhen Aviation (Management) is taken as a dual award with a Bachelor of Commerce, the following rules also apply:\n\nECON1203 and MATH1041 are excluded courses and core courses in both programs. Students must take ECON1203 for their Commerce program and this will be counted towards satisfying the requirements to take MATH1041 in the Aviation program;\nMGMT2721 is an elective in the Aviation (Management) program and an elective in the Commerce program. Where students choose to take this course in either program it may also be used towards meeting the elective requirements of the other program. However, students completing a Management or Human Resource Management major in the Bachelor of Commerce are excluded from taking MGMT2721 and therefore cannot take MGMT2721 as an elective in the Aviation (Management) program. These students will need to choose an alternative course to meet the stage 2 elective requirements in the Aviation (Management) program.\nWhere the requirements for the two programs are completed in less than 192 units of credit due to overlapping courses, students may satisfy the remaining units of credit from those offered by the Business School or the courses listed as electives for the Bachelor of Aviation (Management).\n\nHonours\nStudents can take Honours by enrolling into the 4500 Bachelor of Science (Honours) program and completing the requirements of the Aviation (Honours) stream.\nGraduate Diploma in Flying (5536)\nThe School of Aviation offers a one year full-time 5536 Graduate Diploma in Flying program designed to meet the needs of graduates with an ambition toward a career as a pilot. It allows professional flying training students to obtain a Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) and a Command Instrument Rating Multi-Engine (CIR-ME), as well as undertake academic studies covering the theoretical issues, using Fee-Help. To gain entry to this program, students must:\n\nHave completed a Bachelor of Aviation (Management) undergraduate degree at UNSW or equivalent, or\nHave satisfactorily completed the equivalent of 1 year FTE of the Bachelor of Aviation (Management) at UNSW or equivalent, and\nHold an Australian Class 1 Aviation Medical Certificate, and\nBe an Australian Citizen or Permanent Resident, and\nAttend an interview with Head, School of Aviation or nominee to ascertain suitability with regards to motivation and background.\n\nFor more information regarding this program, contact the School of Aviation. Note: Students taking the Aviation (Management) program as a dual award with a Bachelor of Commerce (i.e. enrolled in 3835) cannot enrol in 5536 Graduate Diploma (Flying) concurrently with their undergraduate studies due to timetabling constraints. Dual award students interested in pursuing flight training through the Graduate Diploma are advised to complete their undergraduate studies before applying for 5536 Graduate Diploma in Flying, or transfer to the single award 3981 Aviation (Management) and apply for 5536 Graduate Diploma in Flying.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nStudents in this program must satisfy the University\'s General Education requirements.

It is expected that all applicants will have a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Standard English, English as a Second Language or Advanced English, or an overall IELTS score of 7.5, with a minimum of 8.0 in Speaking and Listening and a minimum of 7.0 in Reading and Writing, or the equivalent.\nParticipation and Enrolment RequirementsFor accreditation as a teacher in NSW, all teacher education students will need to meet the following participation and enrolment requirements set by the NSW Educations Standards Authority (NESA).\nAssessment of Suitability for TeachingIt is a NESA requirement that all UNSW Bachelor of Education students successfully complete a full year (48 UOC) of studies in their specific disciplinary content area (e.g., Maths, Science, Economics, Arts, etc.) before undertaking any discipline-specific curriculum and pedagogic studies (Methods) or professional experience placements in schools. At the end of their first semester they must also complete a motivational statement as to why they want to be a teacher, which is scored on a 2-point scale: No – incoherent, irrelevant, or inappropriate reasons, or Yes - coherent and valid reason. If students score ‘No’, they will be counselled out of the program. In addition, before their first supervised professional experience placement, all teacher education students must successfully complete:\n\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education.\nThe Classroom Readiness Questionnaire. The Classroom Readiness Questionnaire is a pre-professional experience self-assessment tool that requires students to provide evidence of success across six areas (subject content, inherent requirements, professional language/literacy/numeracy, oral communication, classroom management, and commitment to the profession). Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years. This is the only training that will be accepted by the DoE to meet the requirement of anaphylaxis training for initial Teacher Education Students.\nAward with Distinction\nYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.\nHonours\nAfter completion of 144 UOC including all of the requirements of the  Bachelor of Education (Secondary) dual degree, high achieving students may apply for admission to the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509.

Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years. This is the only training that will be accepted by the DoE to meet the requirement of anaphylaxis training for initial Teacher Education Students.\nAward with DistinctionYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.HonoursAfter completion of 144 UOC including all of the requirements of the  Bachelor of Education (Secondary) dual degree, high achieving students may apply for admission to the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509.

It is expected that all applicants will have a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Standard English, English as a Second Language or Advanced English, or an overall IELTS score of 7.5, with a minimum of 8.0 in Speaking and Listening and a minimum of 7.0 in Reading and Writing, or the equivalent.\nParticipation and Enrolment RequirementsFor accreditation as a teacher in NSW, all teacher education students will need to meet the following participation and enrolment requirements set by the NSW Educations Standards Authority (NESA).\nAssessment of Suitability for TeachingIt is a NESA requirement that all UNSW Bachelor of Education students successfully complete a full year (48 UOC) of studies in their specific disciplinary content area (e.g., Maths, Science, Economics, Arts, etc.) before undertaking any discipline-specific curriculum and pedagogic studies (Methods) or professional experience placements in schools. At the end of their first semester they must also complete a motivational statement as to why they want to be a teacher, which is scored on a 2-point scale: No – incoherent, irrelevant, or inappropriate reasons, or Yes - coherent and valid reason. If students score ‘No’, they will be counselled out of the program. In addition, before their first supervised professional experience placement, all teacher education students must successfully complete:\n\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education.\nThe Classroom Readiness Questionnaire. The Classroom Readiness Questionnaire is a pre-professional experience self-assessment tool that requires students to provide evidence of success across six areas (subject content, inherent requirements, professional language/literacy/numeracy, oral communication, classroom management, and commitment to the profession). Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years. This is the only training that will be accepted by the DoE to meet the requirement of anaphylaxis training for initial Teacher Education Students.\nAward with Distinction\nYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.\nHonours\nAfter completion of 144 UOC, including all of the requirements of the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) component of the dual degree, high achieving students may apply for admission into honours in the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509.

Entry to the BSc (Honours) Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in a School’s Honours program. Typically students require a minimum overall WAM of a Credit for entry into Honours, although due to the competitive nature of Honours in some Schools, the level of academic performance required may be higher. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to the entry requirements, Schools may consider academic performance in the major area of study. All decisions regarding entry to the BSc (Honours) are subject to the approval of the Program Authority.Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed all the requirements for the B. Env. Mgmt. and satisfied all prerequisite requirements for Honours as specified by the relevant School. Students should check prerequisite requirements for Honours with the relevant School and consider potential projects and supervision as early as possible.It is recommended that students who are granted admission into the BSc Honours Program delay their graduation from 3965 until after they complete Honours and so graduate with Bachelor of Environmental Management in [name of Major completed] and Bachelor of Science (Honours) in [name of Honours Plan completed].The completion of Honours is a typical pathway for students who wish to undertake a postgraduate research qualification.The B. Env. Mgmt. and Honours in Environmental Management is also articulated with the Masters of Environmental Management (Program 8623) and the nested Graduate Diploma (Program 5499) and Graduate Certificate (Program 7339). Students who have completed the B. Env. Mgmt. may receive recognition of prior learning and some Advanced Standing in these postgraduate coursework programs.\n'),('3955','\nWith this dual degree program, students take the 120 units of credit (UOC) core of the Bachelor of Environmental Management program (program 3965) and the 96 units of credit core of the Bachelor of Arts program (program 3409), for a total of 216 UOC. Where students complete the requirements for the two awards in less than 216 UOC due to overlapping courses, they will need to take additional courses from the Faculty of Science or the Faculty of Arts and Social Science to bring their total units completed to 216 UOC. Please see ‘Academic Rules’ below for more details.\n'),('3871','\nFoundation science courses are an important component of the early stages of the program and include chemistry, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, statistics and psychology. Building on this knowledge base, the medical sciences of anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology are studied concurrently with the exercise science sub-disciplines of biomechanics, motor control and exercise psychology - leading to an integrated understanding of human function in health and disease and how this is impacted by exercise. The professional role of Exercise Physiologists is emphasised from the commencement of the program in Stage 1 exercise science courses. Clinical courses in Stage 3 cover the four broad areas of practice for Exercise Physiologists being, 1) the primary prevention of disease in apparently healthy populations, 2) the management of chronic diseases under the broad categories of cardiopulmonary and metabolic conditions, 3) musculoskeletal conditions and work hardening and 4) neuromuscular conditions. Courses offer a mixture of traditional and interactive/case study approaches to learning. Clinical practicum is a major component of this program with 100 hours completed across Stage 1 to 3 (as an element of course work) and 400 hours in dedicated clinical practicum courses in Stage 4. Clinical placements include the University\'s Lifestyle Clinic, and hospitals and private practices. Students undertake a research project completed in Stage 4 to refine skills specific to their areas of interest, and to further develop understanding of research and the scientific method and how this informs clinical practice.Elective courses provide flexibility in the program and allow students to select courses according to their areas of interest and career specialisation. These may include: cardiopulmonary conditions, metabolic conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, neuromuscular conditions, nutrition, mental health, and rehabilitation biomechanics. Specific elective courses available are listed below under Electives.General Education is a requirement of all undergraduate programs at UNSW Sydney. Elective and General Education courses in Stages 3 and 4 provide flexibility to facilitate international exchange in the latter stages of the program, while still completing the core courses and practicum required to be eligible to become an Accredited Exercise Physiologist.\nSTAGE ONE\nSemester 1\nBABS1201 Molecules, Cells and Genes (6 UOC)CHEM1831 Chemistry for Health Science (6 UOC)HESC1501 Introductory Exercise Science (6 UOC)PSYC1001 Psychology 1A (6 UOC)\nSemester 2\nANAT2111 Introductory Anatomy (6 UOC)HESC1511 Exercise Programs & Behaviou (6 UOC)MATH1041 Stats for Life & Soc Sciences (6 UOC)PSYC1011 Psychology 1B (6 UOC)\nSTAGE TWO\nSemester 1\nANAT2451 Functional Anatomy for HESC (6 UOC)BIOC2181 Fundamentals of Biochemistry (6 UOC)BIOM2451 Biomech for Sports Scientists (6 UOC)PHSL2501 Human Physiology A (6 UOC)\nSemester 2\nHESC2452 Movement Assessment & Instruct (6 UOC)HESC2501 Exercise Physiology (6 UOC)PATH2202 Proc in Disease Hlth & Ex Sci (6 UOC)PHSL2502 Human Physiology B (6 UOC)\nSTAGE THREE\nSemester 1\nHESC3504 Physical Activity and Health (6 UOC)HESC3541 Clinical Exercise Physiology (6 UOC)NEUR3101 Muscle and Motor Control (6 UOC)PHAR3111 Clinical Pharmacology for HESC (6 UOC)\nSemester 2\nHESC3532 Movement Rehabilitation (6 UOC)HESC3581 Physical Activity in Speci Pop (6 UOC)HESC3592 Neuromuscular Rehabilitation (6 UOC)HESC4501 Ex Phys Research Seminars (6 UOC)\nSTAGE FOUR\nSemester 1\nHESC4551 Research Project (6 UOC)HESC4611 Clinical Practicum A (6 UOC)\nPlus 12 UOC of General Education or Elective or Advanced Clinical Elective (listed below)HESC4551 Research Project may be taken in Semester 1 or 2\nSemester 2\nHESC4622 Clinical Practicum B (6 UOC)PHCM4013 Influencing Health Beliefs (6 UOC)\nPlus 12 UOC of General Education or Elective or Advanced Clinical Elective (listed below)\nCLINICAL PRACTICUM\nA Senior First Aid and CPR Certificate must be obtained before commencing HESC4611 Clinical Practicum A and must be valid for the duration of the clinical practicum courses.

At the end of their first semester they must also complete a motivational statement as to why they want to be a teacher, which is scored on a 2-point scale: No – incoherent, irrelevant, or inappropriate reasons, or Yes - coherent and valid reason. If students score ‘No’, they will be counselled out of the program. In addition, before their first supervised professional experience placement, all teacher education students must successfully complete:\n\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education.\nThe Classroom Readiness Questionnaire. The Classroom Readiness Questionnaire is a pre-professional experience self-assessment tool that requires students to provide evidence of success across six areas (subject content, inherent requirements, professional language/literacy/numeracy, oral communication, classroom management, and commitment to the profession). Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years.

Information on how to declare a major can be found on the Science Student Centre website.   3.   Approved majors in the Bachelor of Life Sciences program are:\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          \n             Anatomy\n          \n          \n             Ecology\n          \n          \n             Molecular and Cell Biology\n          \n          \n             Psychology\n          \n        \n        \n          \n             Biology\n          \n          \n             Genetics\n          \n          \n             Pathology\n          \n          \n             \n          \n        \n        \n          \n             Biological Chemistry\n          \n          \n             Marine and Coastal Science\n          \n          \n             Pharmacology\n          \n          \n             \n          \n        \n        \n          \n             Biotechnology\n          \n          \n             Microbiology\n          \n          \n             Physiology\n          \n          \n             \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n   4.   Students must complete at least 6 UOC of courses with the course code BABS####, and at least 6 UOC of courses with the course code BIOS####.Most students will take these courses in their first year of study, and many majors require courses from these both of these fields, which will fulfil this requirement.  For instance, the Marine and Coastal Science major requires students to complete BABS1201 and BIOS1101 in their first year.  Other majors do not require these courses and students must complete at least one BABS#### course and one BIOS#### course at some stage in their program.   5.  In addition to the courses required for a student\'s chosen major, students must take \'science\' courses so that the major plus \'science\' courses total 96 units of credit.  Majors in the Bachelor of Life Sciences range from 60 units of credit to 90 units of credit,  therefore students will typically need to take additional \'science\' courses depending on the major chosen. Some of these additional science courses may need to be at level I depending on whether a major meets rule 6 below. Where a student chooses to complete a double major, provided that the sum of the courses required for the two majors is greater than 96 units of credit, this requirement is met.\'Science\' courses are courses offered by the following Schools. The course prefixes that are associated with each School are in bold below:Table 1: Definition of \'Science\' courses \n    \n      \n        \n          Aviation\n          AVIA\n        \n        \n          Biological Earth and Environmental Sciences\n          BEES, BIOS, CLIM, ENVS, GEOS, MSCI\n        \n        \n          Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences\n          BABS, BIOC, BIOT, INOV, MICR\n        \n        \n          Chemistry\n          CHEM\n        \n        \n          Computer Science\n          COMP\n        \n        \n          Data Science\n          DATA\n        \n        \n          Food Science\n          FOOD\n        \n        \n          Materials Science and Engineering\n          MATS\n        \n        \n          Mathematics and Statistics\n          MATH\n        \n        \n          Medical Sciences\n          ANAT, NEUR, PATH, PHAR, PHSL, SOMS\n        \n        \n          Psychology\n          PSYC\n        \n        \n          Physics\n          PHYS\n        \n        \n          Optometry and Vision Science\n          OPTM, VISN\n        \n        \n          Science Faculty\n          SCIF\n        \n      \n    \n  \n   6.  Students must complete at least 24 units of credit of science level I courses.Most majors in the Bachelor of Life Sciences already satisfy this requirement, for example, the Ecology major requires BIOS1101, BIOS1301, GEOS1701 and MATH1041. This is a total of 24 units of credit of \'science\' level I courses, therefore, no more level I science courses are required.   7.  12 units of credit of general education must be taken and these may be taken at any stage in a student\'s program.Students must follow the UNSW rules for general education. GENS#### courses, or any course defined as a \'science\' course in Table 1, cannot be taken as general education.

At the end of their first semester they must also complete a motivational statement as to why they want to be a teacher, which is scored on a 2-point scale: No – incoherent, irrelevant, or inappropriate reasons, or Yes - coherent and valid reason. If students score ‘No’, they will be counselled out of the program. In addition, before their first supervised professional experience placement, all teacher education students must successfully complete:\n\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education.\nThe Classroom Readiness Questionnaire. The Classroom Readiness Questionnaire is a pre-professional experience self-assessment tool that requires students to provide evidence of success across six areas (subject content, inherent requirements, professional language/literacy/numeracy, oral communication, classroom management, and commitment to the profession). Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years. This is the only training that will be accepted by the DoE to meet the requirement of anaphylaxis training for initial Teacher Education Students.\nAward with DistinctionYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.HonoursAfter completion of 144 UOC including all of the requirements of the  Bachelor of Education (Secondary) dual degree, high achieving students may apply for admission to the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509.

However, if students cannot undertake a bridging course, they may do the following:-\n\nChemistry: Where students have not completed chemistry at high school, they can enrol in CHEM1001 Introductory Chemistry in semester 1, CHEM1011 Chemistry A in semester 2, and CHEM1021 Chemistry B in summer semester. CHEM1001 will then count as the student\'s science elective to meet program requirements;\nMathematics: Where students have not completed any Mathematics, or have done General Mathematics, or have not achieved the necessary grade in HSC Mathematics, they should consult with the Science Student Centre about their options.\n\nNotes:1 Instead of taking SCIF1111 Perspectives in Med. Science in semester 1, students may take SCIF1131 Introductory Skills for Science in semester 2, depending on the science elective students wish to take and when that course is offered.2 Instead of taking MATH1041 Statistics for Life and Social Sciences in semester 1, students may take this course in semester 2, depending on the science elective students wish to take and when that course is offered.3 Students with a strong Mathematical background (i.e. a result over 90 in HSC Mathematics, or combined result over 100 in HSC Mathematics and HSC Mathematics Extension 1) may consider enrolling in higher level Mathematics courses instead of MATH1041 Statistics for Life and Social Sciences in their first year. Where students are interested, and able, they can get approval from the Program Authority (Science Student Centre) to enrol in MATH1131 Mathematics 1A or MATH1141 Higher Mathematics 1A (semester 1) and MATH1231 Mathematics 1B or MATH1241 Higher Mathematics 1B (semester 2). MATH1231 Mathematics 1B (or MATH1241 Higher Mathematics 1B) will then count as the student\'s science elective.4 Only one of these courses is required. Students who have achieved at least a credit in BABS1201 can take either BABS2204 Genetics or BABS2202 Molecular Biology I. All other students should take BIOS1101. Students wishing to complete a major in Medical Microbiology or Molecular Biology must take BABS2202 in their first year. Students wishing to complete a major in Molecular Genetics must take BABS2204 in their first year.   5 Courses defined as \"Science\" courses are shown in Table 1 of the Bachelor of Science (program 3970). Courses may be offered in semester 1 or semester 2, and students should refer to notes 1 and 2 above about how they can rearrange their BMedSci first year program to undertake a science elective in semester 1.\nStage 2Semester 1\nANAT2241 Histology:Basic and Systematic (6 UOC)BIOC2101 Principles of Biochem (Adv) (6 UOC)MICR2011 Microbiology 1 (6 UOC)PHSL2101 Physiology 1A (6 UOC)\nSemester 2\nBIOC2201 Principles of Mol.

It has a modular structure comprising a series of fully integrated courses studied over 26 teaching periods, generally each of 8 weeks duration.  There are 4 teaching periods in Years 1-4 approximating the University semester timetable. There is an additional teaching period (Summer Teaching Period) in years 5-6.  In most years, the standard UNSW program load of 48 UOC per year will apply.As part of the program, students are required to satisfy the University\'s General Education requirements. Please see General Education below.The program is organised into two degrees:Bachelor of Medical Studies (BMed)The BMed includes Phase 1 and Phase 2.  Phase 1 commences with the Foundations course, followed by 7 x 8 week courses focussing on basic medical sciences in relation to the human life cycle; social, ethical and legal issues related to health care; and early experience in clinical or other health-related environments.  During this phase, students will undertake a variety of learning activities involving students from different stages of the program working collaboratively in small groups.  Phase 2 consists of 2 x 16-week courses, with increased clinical content and an emphasis on correlation between prior and current learning.Doctor of Medicine (MD)The MD includes the Independent Learning Project (ILP), followed by a Clinical Transition Course prior to the Phase 3 courses.  During the Independent Learning Project students should also complete 12 UOC of General Education courses in a faculty or faculties other than Medicine.Phase 3 consists of 10 x 8-week courses with a clinical focus, but still includes relevant content from the basic medical sciences and the social sciences. Students are required to complete a course in the disciplines of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Psychiatry, Primary Care, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Children\'s Health (Paediatrics). Students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete Phase 3 requirements. In addition, a student\'s clinical experiences during Phase 3 must include a minimum of 4 weeks in a rural location. All clinical courses in Phase 3 adopt the principles of clinical clerkship, in which students learn through experience and participation in the treatment of patients under the care of medical practitioners and/or medical teams to which they are attached.In all phases of the program, students will be required to travel to various clinical environments associated with UNSW, which will be the predominant locations for learning in Phases 2 and 3. These locations include Clinical Schools associated with St Vincent\'s Hospital, Darlinghurst; St George Hospital, Kogarah; the Randwick Campus Hospitals; various locations in the South Western Sydney Clinical School based around Liverpool; and the Rural Clinical School, which has campuses in the Greater Murray and Mid-North coast areas. Throughout the program, students may be attached to multiple sites, which will typically include at least 4 weeks in a non-metropolitan setting.Students wishing to undertake a full year of research may be able to enrol in the BSc (Med) Honours program 3831 subject to the approval from the Honours Committee. These students will be exempt from undertaking the Independent Learning Project.

Prospective teachers must be able to communicate effectively with school students and staff members.It is expected that all applicants will have a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Standard English or a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in English as a Second Language or a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Advanced English or an overall IELTS score of 7.5, with a minimum of 8.0 in speaking and Listening and a minimum of 7.0 in reading and writing or the equivalent.\nParticipation and Enrolment RequirementsFor accreditation as a teacher in NSW, all teacher education students will need to meet the following participation and enrolment requirements set by the NSW Educations Standards Authority (NESA).\nAssessment of Suitability for TeachingIt is a NESA requirement that all UNSW Bachelor of Education students successfully complete a full year (48 UOC) of studies in their specific disciplinary content area (e.g., Maths, Science, Economics, Arts, etc.) before undertaking any discipline-specific curriculum and pedagogic studies (Methods) or professional experience placements in schools. At the end of their first semester they must also complete a motivational statement as to why they want to be a teacher, which is scored on a 2-point scale: No – incoherent, irrelevant, or inappropriate reasons, or Yes - coherent and valid reason. If students score ‘No’, they will be counselled out of the program. In addition, before their first supervised professional experience placement, all teacher education students must successfully complete:\n\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education.\nThe Classroom Readiness Questionnaire. The Classroom Readiness Questionnaire is a pre-professional experience self-assessment tool that requires students to provide evidence of success across six areas (subject content, inherent requirements, professional language/literacy/numeracy, oral communication, classroom management, and commitment to the profession). Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years. This is the only training that will be accepted by the DoE to meet the requirement of anaphylaxis training for initial Teacher Education Students.\nAward with Distinction\nYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.\nHonours\nAfter completion of 144 UOC including all of the requirements of the  Bachelor of Education (Secondary) dual degree, high achieving students may apply for admission to the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509.

Prospective teachers must be able to communicate effectively with school students and staff members.It is expected that all applicants will have a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Standard English or a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in English as a Second Language or a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Advanced English or an overall IELTS score of 7.5, with a minimum of 8.0 in speaking and Listening and a minimum of 7.0 in reading and writing or the equivalent.\nParticipation and Enrolment RequirementsFor accreditation as a teacher in NSW, all teacher education students will need to meet the following participation and enrolment requirements set by the NSW Educations Standards Authority (NESA).\nAssessment of Suitability for TeachingIt is a NESA requirement that all UNSW Bachelor of Education students successfully complete a full year (48 UOC) of studies in their specific disciplinary content area (e.g., Maths, Science, Economics, Arts, etc.) before undertaking any discipline-specific curriculum and pedagogic studies (Methods) or professional experience placements in schools. At the end of their first semester they must also complete a motivational statement as to why they want to be a teacher, which is scored on a 2-point scale: No – incoherent, irrelevant, or inappropriate reasons, or Yes - coherent and valid reason. If students score ‘No’, they will be counselled out of the program. In addition, before their first supervised professional experience placement, all teacher education students must successfully complete:\n\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education.\nThe Classroom Readiness Questionnaire. The Classroom Readiness Questionnaire is a pre-professional experience self-assessment tool that requires students to provide evidence of success across six areas (subject content, inherent requirements, professional language/literacy/numeracy, oral communication, classroom management, and commitment to the profession). Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years. This is the only training that will be accepted by the DoE to meet the requirement of anaphylaxis training for initial Teacher Education Students.\nAward with Distinction\nYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.\nHonours\nAfter completion of 144 UOC including all of the requirements of the  Bachelor of Education (Secondary) dual degree, high achieving students may apply for admission to the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509.

The research project may be undertaken in most areas of psychology including: psychopathology; behavioural neuroscience; cognitive science; cognition and perception; forensic psychology; organisational psychology; and social, personality and developmental psychology. Students can indicate their preferred research areas but cannot be guaranteed the supervisor of their choice. The Honours coursework requirement includes content that encompasses history, professional ethics, evidence-based practice and advanced coverage of selected contemporary issues in psychology that reflect the expertise and research specialisations of School staff.The research project culminates in and is assessed by a written thesis. This thesis is assessed independently by two academics, neither of which is the student\'s supervisor. Where there is a discrepancy in the marks between the two assessors, a third assessor may be engaged.  At the completion of their Honours program students will be awarded an honours grading as follows:\n\nHonours Class 1: mark of 85 or greater;\nHonours Class 2 Division 1: mark from 75 to 84;\nHonours Class 2 Division 2: mark from 65 to 74;\nHonours Class 3: mark from 50 to 64.\n\nThe calculation of class of award will be determined from the student’s weighted average mark for all of the courses (research-based and coursework) required in the final year of the  program. Only courses completed as part of the final fourth-year Honours will be included within an honours calculation.\nAcademic Rules\nRequirements for the Bachelor of Psychology(Honours) in Dual Mode Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Psychology(Honours) as one part of a dual degree must complete a minimum of 144 Units of Credit (UoC) for the award of the degree.  Academic rules relating to the Bachelor of Psychology (Honours) as one part of a dual degree are as follows:\n\nStudents must complete a minimum of 144 units of credit (UOC).\nStudents must follow the program of study as outlined in this Handbook and defined under the Program Structure above, completing a minimum of 144 UOC in Psychology including 48 UOC in Psychology at Honours level.\nNo student may commence level II courses until 24 units of credit of level I courses have been successfully completed.\nStudents may commence level III courses upon successful completion of 72 units of credit.\nStudents will not be allowed to progress to Stage 4 (Honours) unless they achieve an average of 75% or higher across Psychology courses that they have taken as part of the Psychology major sequence, i.e. level 1 elective courses in Psychology such as PSYC1022, PSYC1023, PSYC1024 and PSYC1031 do not count in the calculation of this average. Students achieving an average of 70%-74.99% across Psychology major courses may be admitted subject to appropriate research and supervision resources being available and at the discretion of the Head of School. Students with an average of less than 70% across all Psychology major courses will normally not be admitted. Students not gaining admission into Honours are required to transfer to 4722 Psychological Science / Law.\nThe final grading for the degree is based on performance in Stage 4 (Honours) of the degree. Award: Class I, Class II of Division 1, Class II Division 2, or Honours Class 3. Students who achieve less than 50% in the Honours program will be awarded the Pass degree, Bachelor of Psychological Science.\nStudy Load: This is a four-stage full-time program. In any one session students must enrol in a full study load of 24 UoC in accordance with the requirements of the program. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be allowed to enrol in a reduced program for a Stage.\nAcademic Standing: Students are required to achieve an average of 70 percent or higher in Psychology courses taken in any Stage (based on the first attempted result for each course). Students not maintaining this level of performance in Stage 1 will be counselled. Students who fail to achieve an average of 70 percent or higher in all Psychology courses taken in Stages 2 and 3 will normally be required to transfer to the 4722 Bachelor of Psychological Science/ Law.\n\nRequirements for the Bachelor of Laws For '),('3970','\nSingle ModeWhen completing the Bachelor of Science as a single degree, students must complete a minimum of 144 units of credit (UoC).

However, the academic requirements for particular disciplines within Science may be higher due to the competitive nature of Honours in some disciplines and the number of Honours places available within a School. Disciplines may also have particular prerequisite requirements for entry into Honours, and may consider a student’s performance in their major area of study when assessing their eligibility for admission. Students must apply to the relevant School for admission into Honours, and admission requirements as well as the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee.  For details of the entry requirements for a particular discipline, please see the relevant plan entry in this Handbook.To apply for admission to Honours, students should contact the relevant School for information on research projects, available supervisors, and entry requirements. Once students have located a suitable supervisor, they should lodge an application for Honours to the School by the advertised deadlines. Deadlines for these are found on the School’s webpages. Students who have not completed their undergraduate degree at UNSW, or completed their UNSW degree at least 6 months beforehand, will need to lodge two applications – one to the relevant School, and another to the UNSW Admissions Office (http://www.unsw.edu.au/node/365). Note: this Honours program is the honours pathway from the following UNSW Science programs: 3980 Bachelor of Aviation (Flying), 3981 Bachelor of Aviation (Management); 3970 Bachelor of Science, 3925 Bachelor of Science and Business, 3965 Bachelor of Science (Environmental Management), 3987 Bachelor of Science (International), and 3991 Bachelor of Medical Science, and the associated dual degrees. Program StructureThe Bachelor of Science (Honours) is comprised of 48 units of credit. It includes an independent research project under the guidance of an academic supervisor culminating in a written thesis, and may include higher-level coursework, compulsory attendance at OH&S training, writing literature reviews and research proposals, attending workshops and lectures, and attending and presenting seminars. The Honours year normally commences in semester 1 and is undertaken full-time over 1 year. However mid-year entry and part-time enrolment may be available at the discretion of the relevant School. The independent research project will typically be worth 24-48 units of credit undertaken across the entire year (or part-time equivalent). For details of the structure and assessment of honours for a particular discipline, please refer to the plan pages below.

If students wish to take these courses they are expected to use their free electives to complete necessary prerequisites. Students may apply for additional courses to be considered for this list through the Science Student Centre. Courses will be considered by the Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs) or nominee if they fulfil the objectives of the Bachelor of Science (International) program.6. In addition to the courses required for a student\'s chosen major, the language minor and 24 UoC of Directed Electives, students must take ‘Science’ courses so that the major plus language minor plus Directed Electives plus ‘Science’ courses total at least 168 UoC. ‘Science’ courses are listed in Table 1 below. 7. Students must complete at least 24 UoC of Level I ‘Science’ courses. ‘Science’ courses are listed in Table 1 below.8. Students must complete an international exchange of 24-48 units of credit (one or two semesters) at an approved UNSW overseas partner university. Click for a list of partner universities. The exchange is governed by the following rules:\n\nTo proceed on exchange students must have achieved satisfactory academic progress in their first and second years of study, typically with no more than one fail on their transcript, and must fulfil the requirements of the University\'s exchange program.\nStudents must complete 120 units of credit before they can go on exchange, i.e. the exchange program is completed in Year 3 semester 2, and Year 4 semester 1.\nA Faculty of Science Travel Bursary will be available for students who undertake the international exchange as part of this program. This bursary will represent a small contribution from the Faculty towards the cost of undertaking the exchange. Students can only apply for the Scholarship once and scholarship applications must be submitted prior to the commencement of the UNSW Exchange program.  Applications submitted upon completion of the exchange program will not be accepted.\nStudents must apply to go on exchange through the Study Abroad and Exchange Office, 9 months in advanced of their intended exchange. Click for details on how to apply for Student Exchange.\n\nThere are no restrictions on a student\'s selection of courses while on exchange, however, students should be enrolled full-time and all courses taken must count towards meeting the degree requirements such that the degree can be completed in the minimum time. Students should note that it can sometimes be difficult finding exact matches to core courses for a major at foreign universities, and it may be easier to take elective courses (‘Science’ electives Free Electives or Directed Electives) while on exchange. Therefore students should plan their enrolment over the four years of the Bachelor of Science (International) degree accordingly. Students who do not satisfy the criteria for exchange will normally be required to transfer to another program for which they are eligible, for example the Bachelor of Science (program 3970).9. A maximum of 72 units of credit of Level I courses can be taken throughout the entire degree. 10. Students may not enrol into Level II courses until at least 30 UoC of Level I courses have been successfully completed. 11. Students may not enrol into Level III courses until at least 72 UoC of courses have been successfully completed. 12.  Progression to stages 2,3 and 4 is subject to satisfactory progress. Students who do not meet a minimum weighted average mark (WAM) of 65 at the end of stage 2 will be required to transfer to program 3970 Bachelor of Science. Students who are otherwise deemed ineligible to proceed on exchange will also be required to transfer to program 3970 Bachelor of Science.\nTable 1: Definition of \'Science\' courses \'Science\' courses are courses offered by the following Schools.

Students will not be eligible for Honours in the Australian School of Business. Students who have not qualified for the Bachelor of Science and Business at pass level (144 UoC) cannot be considered for enrolment in Honours.Progression to Stage 4 Honours is subject to academic performance, the academic requirements for a particular discipline, and the number of places available in the School’s Honours program. Typically students require a minimum overall WAM (weighted average mark) of 65% for entry into Honours, although due to the competitive nature of Honours the entry requirements for some Schools may be significantly higher. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to, 65% Schools may take into consideration a student’s academic performance in their major area of study when assessing the application to enter Honours. If a student’s overall WAM is 65% or better, but the performance in the major area of study is less than 65%, a School may decline to accept an application to enter Honours.Students must have satisfied prerequisite requirements for Honours as specified by a particular School. Students contemplating Honours should check the prerequisite requirements for Honours with the relevant School as early as possible in their second year of study. Students must apply to the relevant School for admission to Honours, and admission requirements as well as the number of places per intake are determined by the Head of School or nominee.\nHonours in Laws\nHigh achieving students may be eligible to graduate with a Bachelor of Laws (Honours).Please visit the Honours in law website for further information about the current Honours policy (applicable to students who commenced the LLB in 2014 or earlier) and the new policy (applicable to students who commenced the LLB from 2015 onwards).\nAcademic Rules\nRequirements for the Bachelor of Science and Business in concurrent mode\n\nStudents enrolled in the Bachelor of Science and Business must complete a minimum of 144 units of credit (UoC).\nStudents must complete exactly one approved Bachelor of Science and Business major.

It is expected that all applicants will have a Higher School Certificate minimum Band 5 in Standard English, English as a Second Language or Advanced English, or an overall IELTS score of 7.5, with a minimum of 8.0 in Speaking and Listening and a minimum of 7.0 in Reading and Writing, or the equivalent.\nParticipation and Enrolment RequirementsFor accreditation as a teacher in NSW, all teacher education students will need to meet the following participation and enrolment requirements set by the NSW Educations Standards Authority (NESA).\nAssessment of Suitability for TeachingIt is a NESA requirement that all UNSW Bachelor of Education students successfully complete a full year (48 UOC) of studies in their specific disciplinary content area (e.g., Maths, Science, Economics, Arts, etc.) before undertaking any discipline-specific curriculum and pedagogic studies (Methods) or professional experience placements in schools. At the end of their first semester they must also complete a motivational statement as to why they want to be a teacher, which is scored on a 2-point scale: No – incoherent, irrelevant, or inappropriate reasons, or Yes - coherent and valid reason. If students score ‘No’, they will be counselled out of the program. In addition, before their first supervised professional experience placement, all teacher education students must successfully complete:\n\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education.\nThe Classroom Readiness Questionnaire. The Classroom Readiness Questionnaire is a pre-professional experience self-assessment tool that requires students to provide evidence of success across six areas (subject content, inherent requirements, professional language/literacy/numeracy, oral communication, classroom management, and commitment to the profession). Their self-assessments are then endorsed (or not) by at least two staff members who teach them.\nA situational judgement test. This test is a scenario-based measurement tool designed to assess individuals’ judgement in a contextualised workplace setting. This test evaluates a number of key non-academic capabilities deemed necessary for teaching (e.g., adaptability, empathy).\n\nWe also undertake extensive evaluation of teacher suitability for their specific teaching areas. We do this via: (a) including a compulsory microteaching assessment in Methods courses, (b) using direct observation of all professional experience placements, including the first semester placement as a teaching assistant, (c) multiple critical assessment tasks, (d) a teaching performance assessment, and (e) a set of inherent requirements used by a range of UNSW teacher education providers. We continually monitor and evaluate the relationship between these measures, the performance during professional experience, and graduate outcomes, including level of self-efficacy.\nEnglish Language ProficiencyIt is a NESA requirement that all teacher education students have very high levels of English language proficiency, thus in addition to satisfying UNSW entry requirements, see www.unsw.edu.au/english-requirements-policy, oral and written communication skills are assessed regularly as part of all coursework and professional experience. By graduation it is expected that all teacher education students will be able to demonstrate English language proficiency equivalent to a Band 5 NSW HSC- level or an IELTS 7.5, with 8.0 for speaking and listening.\nThe National Literacy and Numeracy TestThe National Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students is designed to assess initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills to ensure teachers are well equipped to meet the demands of teaching, and assist higher education providers, teacher employers, and the general public to have increased confidence in the skills of graduating teachers.The test has been introduced to assess those aspects of initial teacher education students’ personal literacy and numeracy skills that can be measured through an online assessment tool. At UNSW, students must successfully complete both components of the LANTITE test prior to enrolling in their first Professional Experience course. You are supplied with information for the tests though Moodle and the link is provided at https://teacheredtest.acer.edu.au. Successful completion of the LANTITE test will be recorded as two zero credit courses, EDST6600 LANTITE (Literacy) and EDST6601 LANTITE (Numeracy) on a student’s academic record.\nWorking With Children CheckBefore their first professional experience placement, all teacher education students must obtain a current Volunteer Working With Children Check (WWC) and attend a UNSW-based 2-hour child protection lecture delivered by the Department of Education – Employee Performance and Conduct Directorate. They must provide a copy of their WWC clearance number to the Professional Experience Office (PEO) via the Online Placement System (OPS). The PEO verifies all WWC numbers in the Office of the Children’s Guardian verification page for employers (https://wwccheck.ccyp.nsw.gov.au/Employers/Login) and classifies students as ‘eligible’ for placement, or not. All EDST 6765 Professional Experience 2 students must then obtain a valid paid WWC clearance. For more information about volunteer and paid WWC Checks, find the link here: https://www.kidsguardian.nsw.gov.au/child-safe-organisations/working-with-children-check.All students must also familiarise themselves with the NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct and the document Responding to Allegations against Employees in the Area of Child Protection. All students are provided access to the policy via the Professional Experience Handbook specific to their year of placement.\nAnaphylaxis Training & CertificationThe NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) and the Department of Education (DoE) has mandated the completion of anaphylaxis e-training for all permanent, temporary, and casual employees who work in schools, including teacher education students. All UNSW teacher education students must complete the anaphylaxis e-training module provided by the Australian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) in conjunction with practice using an adrenaline auto-injector training device prior to commencing their first placement in schools.The e-training is a free, online module available at http://etraining.allergy.org.au/. On successful completion of the online module, participants will receive a certificate of completion which should be printed immediately. The Professional Experience Office will then arrange practice using the adrenaline auto-injector training device. Students are then required to upload their signed certificate to the OPS. NESA and the DoE require that students also present a copy of their certificate of completion to principals at the commencement of their professional experience placements. Students should also retain a copy of the certificate for future use within the two years of the certificate’s currency.The NSW DoE advises that student teachers who do not successfully complete this training, as verified by the university and the principal of their placement school, will not be able to undertake professional experience activities in NSW public schools. The training is required to be successfully undertaken every two years. This is the only training that will be accepted by the DoE to meet the requirement of anaphylaxis training for initial Teacher Education Students.\nAward with DistinctionYou are eligible for the award of your Pass Degree \"with Distinction\" if you achieve a Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of at least 75 in all courses and complete at least 50% of the requirements of your award at UNSW.\nHonours\nAfter completion of 144 UOC including all of the requirements of the  Bachelor of Education (Secondary) dual degree, high achieving students may apply for admission to the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509. A minimum WAM of 70 in the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) component of the dual degree is required for entry into Honours. Bachelor of Education (Secondary) (Honours) program 4509\nAcademic Rules\nTo qualify for the award of the degree at Pass level, a student must:\n\nenrol in the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) in Dual mode and complete 96 UOC;\ncomplete the method requirements for one or two areas of teaching specialisation\ncomplete at least 30 UOC of Level 1 courses before enrolling in Level 2 courses\ncomplete at least 30 UOC of Level 2 courses before enrolling in Level 3 courses\n\nRequirements for the Bachelor of Science in Dual Mode\nProgram Structure\nWhen taken concurrently a Bachelor of Science is comprised of 96 units of credit which includes:-\n\nAn approved major from the Bachelor of Science program; and\nScience elective courses.\n\nNote: not all of the majors in the Bachelor of Science are available to students in the BSc/BEd program. Only those majors listed in the table below from the Bachelor of Science are available.\nAcademic Rules\nAcademic rules relating to the Bachelor of Science in Dual mode are as follows:\n\nStudents must complete a minimum of 96 units of credit.\nStudents must complete at least one approved Bachelor of Science major, and this must be declared before enrolling in Level II courses (see the 3970 Bachelor of Science page for approved majors). Information about how to declare a major can be found on the Science Student Centre website.\nStudents may choose to complete an optional minor using their Science electives (see the 3970 Bachelor of Science page for the list of approved minors). Students cannot complete a minor with the same name as their nominated major, and Level II and III courses cannot be double-counted between majors and minors. More than one minor may be completed subject to the limit on double-counting. Students must declare their minor(s) before their final semester.\nIn addition to the courses required for a student\'s chosen major, students must take \'Science\' courses so that the major plus \'Science\' courses total 96 UoC. ‘Science’ courses are listed in Table 1 on the 3970 Bachelor of Science page.\nStudents must complete at least 24 UoC of Level I ‘Science’ courses. ‘Science’ courses are listed in Table 1 of the 3970 Bachelor of Science page.\nStudents may not enrol into Level II courses until at least 30 UoC of Level I courses have been successfully completed.\nStudents may not enrol into Level III courses until at least 72 UoC of courses have been successfully completed.\n\nDouble Majors and Minors in Dual Degrees\nStudents who intend to complete a double major or a major combined with a minor in the Bachelor of Science when taken as part of a dual degree should be aware that it may be difficult to complete these combinations within 96 UoC. This may involve extra time and cost to complete, and  may have visa implications for international students.\nPrescribed Science Electives*\n\nStudents in the Biology major stream need to complete two courses (12 UOC) in one of Chemistry or Physics\nStudents in the Chemistry major stream need to complete two courses (12 UOC) in one of Physics, Biology or Earth & Environmental Science\nStudents in the Physics major stream need to complete two courses (12 UOC) in one of Biology, Chemistry or Earth & Environmental Science\nStudents in the Earth & Environmental Science major stream need to complete one course (6 UOC) in Biology and two courses (12 UOC) in one of Chemistry or Physics\n\nIf the specific major\'s plan allows additional time for Science electives (within the allocated 96 UOC), it is recommended to diversify the selection of science electives by including courses from teaching disciplines (Biology, Physics, Chemistry, or Earth & Environmental Science) that are not represented in the major\'s plan.\n* Students completing the Mathematics for Education major do not need to take science courses from each of the four teaching disciplines, but still need to complete the requirements for the Maths for Education major, and a minimum of 96 UoC of ‘Science’ courses. See additional notes below for students who wish to become Mathematics teachers.\nNote:Physics requirementPhysics courses which can be used to satisfy the Physics requirement in this program include: PHYS1110, PHYS1111, PHYS1121, PHYS1131, PHYS1221, PHYS123I. Please note that PHYS1121 is a pre-requisite for PHYS1221, and PHYS1131 is a pre-requisite for PHYS1231. Also note that most Physics courses have Mathematics courses as a co-requisite. Please refer to the individual handbook entry for these courses for further information.Chemistry requirementStudents would normally choose 6-12 Units of Credit (UOC) Chemistry from CHEM1011 and CHEM1021 (or CHEM1031 and CHEM1041) to satisfy the Chemistry requirements in this program, depending on their level of assumed knowledge. Please refer to the individual handbook entries for these courses for more information on assumed knowledge. Students, who have not completed Year 11 Chemistry or equivalent, should consider doing CHEM1001 first followed by CHEM1011 (and then CHEM1021 where a student is electing to complete 12 UOC of Chemistry.Earth and Environmental Science RequirementCourses that can be used to satisfy the Earth and Environmental Science requirement include: BIOS1301, GEOS1111, GEOS1211 and GEOS1701.\nMajor StreamsNote: not all of the majors in the Bachelor of Science are available to students in the BSc/BEd program. Only those majors listed in the table below from the Bachelor of Science are available.BiologyChemistryPhysicsEarth &  Environmental Science Anatomy Chemistry  Physics Ecology  Biology  Earth Science Biotechnology  Geography  Ecology   Marine ScienceGenetics  Microbiology    Molecular and Cell Biology Pathology    Pharmacology   Physiology    \n Note:  Please refer to the bottom of this page for the specific requirements for streams. Note: In New South Wales high schools teachers typically teach general science (all four sciences) from years 7-10 and specialise in one of the sciences at Senior level (Year 11-12). All major streams listed above qualify students to teach a least one science at senior level. Some major streams qualify students to specialise in more than one science. If students wish to qualify in an additional specialisation, they should complete at least 2 courses in that science. For example, students who complete a major stream in Chemistry can also be qualified in Biology if they complete at least 2. However, it is strongly recommended that students use their open science electives to complete a further 2 x level 2 courses in the second science area to provide a better preparation to teach Stage 6 students in this area.\nMathematics TeachersStudents wishing to become Mathematics teachers will be required to complete:\n\n66 UOC in Mathematics.

In the field education courses, a field educator, usually in a social welfare agency, is responsible for a student learning to apply the principles of professional practice in an actual practice setting. From level 3, a total of 140 seven-hour days are taken up in this way. Forty of these days are scheduled during academic recess periods. A student\'s two field education placements are in more than one type of practice setting. The settings vary and can include medical, psychiatric, local government, community health, community, family and child welfare, services to groups with disabilities, services to the aged, services to migrants, income security, and corrective services. Non-government social welfare agencies and all levels of government are utilised. For some students, their second field education placement may be located outside the Sydney metropolitan area. SOCW3011 and SOCW4014 are the designated field education courses.General EducationGeneral Education is the completion of two courses (12 UOC) offered outside UNSW Arts and Social Sciences. This requirement is met if an external major or minor (for example, Economics) is completed. Indigenous Studies courses (ATSIxxxx) can be studied as General Education only if students are not following a major or minor in Indigenous Studies within the BA program.University MedalAn honours student in this program may be nominated for a University Medal in line with the University Medal Policy http://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/medalspolicy.pdf and Procedures http://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/medalsprocedure.pdf.TAFE Credit TransferStudents admitted to the Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) who have completed an approved TAFE diploma are eligible for credit transfer. Slightly different credit transfers apply to students enrolled in dual degrees. For further information see https://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/disciplines/social-work/tafe-credit-transfer/. \nParticipation and Enrolment Requirements\nWorking with Children CheckThe Working With Children Check is valid for five years. It is a requirement for all students and is specifically designed for people who work or volunteer in child-related work. It involves a national criminal history check and a review of findings of workplace misconduct. The result of a Working With Children Check is either a clearance to work with children for five years, or a bar against working with children. Cleared applicants are subject to ongoing monitoring and relevant new records may lead to the clearance being revoked. The Working With Children Check is fully portable so it can be used for any paid or unpaid child-related work in NSW for as long as the worker remains cleared.You can apply for their Working With Children Check (WWCC) number on the NSW Office of the Children’s Guardian website. To be eligible for a WWCC you will have to show proof of identity to a NSW Motor Registry or Council Agency. For more information you may access the online tutorials and fact sheets at Working with Children Check.National Criminal Record CheckA National Criminal Record Check is valid for three years. You must undergo a National Criminal Record Check and provide an original copy of the Check results to the Work Integrated Learning Unit. The result of a Working With Children Check is either that there are ‘no disclosable outcomes’, or that there are ‘disclosable outcomes’ which are then detailed in the certificate. If you have a disclosable outcome(s) on your criminal record check you will need to undergo a risk assessment. Please contact the Work Integrated Learning Unit for further information about this.All placement students are subject to ongoing monitoring and must disclose new ‘disclosable outcomes’ to the Work Integrated Learning Unit. Some agencies (e.g NSW Health) only accept National Criminal Record Checks obtained through specific accredited agencies.Compliance with NSW Health Vaccination Requirements (NSW Health funded placements)In order to undertake placement in a NSW Health funded facility, you need to demonstrate evidence of protection against the following diseases:• Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough)• Hepatitis B• Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)• Varicella (chickenpox)• Tuberculosis (TB) - As specified on the Vaccination Card, this check is only required if you were born in a country with a high incidence of TB, or you have lived or travelled in a high risk TB country cumulatively for 3 months or more.Evidence of protection against these diseases must be recorded on the NSW Health vaccination card by a GP and serology reports must be provide for some diseases (reports from your doctor where protection is measured in your blood).Green P Drivers LicenceMany agencies require that students have a Green P Drivers Licence or above. Although it is not compulsory to have a NSW Drivers License to undertake placement, it is an essential requirement for social work tasks in most agencies. Not having a Green P or unrestricted Driver’s License will significantly limit student placement options.\nAcademic RulesDual ModeTo qualify for the award of the degree at Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) level, a student must:\n\nenrol in the Bachelor of Social Work and complete 168 UOC;\ncomplete the core requirements\ncomplete 6 UOC of General Education\n\nHonoursHonours will be awarded in the following classes, based on the student\'s WAM rounded to the nearest whole number:Honours Class I (selective WAM of 85 or higher)Honours Class II division 1, (selective WAM of 75-84)Honours Class II division 2 (selective WAM of 65-74)Honours Class III (selective WAM of 50-64)The award will be calculated on the basis of the WAM for Level 3 and 4 Program Core courses in Social Work, with the selected Honours course (SOCW4015 or SOCW4016) weighted as 24 units of credit to recognise integration of learning with professional practice in SOCW4014.The Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of Level 3 and 4 core courses in the Social Work (Honours) program are applied towards the award of the Honours Class. Therefore these courses cannot be undertaken in the Exchange Program as such courses completed are recorded as credit transfer without marks and cannot be included in the WAM calculation.Exit StrategiesStudents unable to meet the requirements of either SOCW3011 or SOCW4014 may exit the program and enrol in the Bachelor of Welfare Studies. It should be noted that this program does not provide eligibility for membership of the Australian Association of Social Workers.Security ChecksIt is a requirement that students who are undertaking placements in certain government departments and related organisations undergo a criminal record check.Professional RecognitionGraduates with the degree of Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) from UNSW are eligible for membership of the Australian Association of Social Workers.\nRequirements for the Bachelor of Criminology & Criminal Justice in Dual ModeProgram StructureThe basic requirements for the degree in Dual mode (96 UOC) are:\n\nCriminology Core (36 UOC)\nSocial Research and Policy Core (42 UOC)\nPrescribed Criminology Electives (12 UOC)\nGeneral Education (6 UOC)\n\nCriminology CoreCompulsory courses (36 UOC) made up of:Level 1\nCRIM1010 Criminology: An Introduction (6 UOC)CRIM1011 Intro to Criminal Justice (6 UOC)\nLevel 2\nCRIM2020 Criminal Law and Justice 1 (6 UOC)CRIM2021 Criminal Law and Justice 2 (6 UOC)\nLevel 3\nCRIM3000 Criminology in Practice (6 UOC)CRIM3001 Explaining Crime (6 UOC)\nSocial Research and Policy CoreCompulsory courses (42 UOC) made up of:Level 1\nSRAP1000 Policy and Society (6 UOC)SRAP1001 Social Research and Society (6 UOC)\nLevel 2\nSRAP2001 Qualitative Social Research (6 UOC)SRAP2002 Policy Analysis ( UOC)\nLevel 3\nSRAP3000 Policy and Social Theory (6 UOC)SRAP3001 Quantitative Social Research (6 UOC)SRAP3002 Social Research & Policy Proj. (6 UOC)\nPrescribed Criminology ElectivesComplete 12 UOC from the following list of Prescribed Criminology Electives:\n\nARTS2845 Sex, Human Rights & Justice (6 UOC)\nARTS3886 Living Social Justice (6 UOC)\nCRIM2014 Issues in Policing (6 UOC)\nCRIM2031 Indigenous Perspective (6 UOC)\nCRIM2036 Prison and Punishment (6 UOC)\nCRIM2037 Explaining Punishment (6 UOC)\nCRIM2038 Young People, Risk and Harm (6 UOC)\nCRIM2040 Criminal Networks (6 UOC)\nCRIM2041 Crime and Punishment (6 UOC)\nCRIM3011 Crime Prevention Policy (6 UOC)\nCRIM3012 Violent & Sexual Offenders (6 UOC)\nCRIM3022 Public Health and Corrections (6 UOC)\nCRIM3024 Issues in Drug Policy (6 UOC)\nHUMS2000 Arts Internship (6 UOC)\nPSYC3301 Psychology and Law (6 UOC)*\n\nThe Handbook only publishes elective courses that are offered each year.* Please seek advice from the coordinator for PSYC3301 about the pre-requisites\nPrescribed Criminology ElectivesA Prescribed Criminology Elective is any course chosen by the student from the approved list of Criminology elective courses provided by the Program.General EducationGeneral Education is the completion of two courses (12 UOC) offered outside UNSW Arts and Social Sciences.

In the field education courses, a field educator, usually in a social welfare agency, is responsible for a student learning to apply the principles of professional practice in an actual practice setting. From level 3, a total of 140 seven-hour days are taken up in this way. Forty of these days are scheduled during academic recess periods. A student\'s two field education placements are in more than one type of practice setting. The settings vary and can include medical, psychiatric, local government, community health, community, family and child welfare, services to groups with disabilities, services to the aged, services to migrants, income security, and corrective services. Non-government social welfare agencies and all levels of government are utilised. For some students, their second field education placement may be located outside the Sydney metropolitan area. SOCW3011 and SOCW4014 are the designated field education courses.Free ElectivesA Free Elective is any course offered either within or outside UNSW Arts and Social Sciences in which the student is able to enrol.ARTS2050 Academic Writing for the Humanities (6 UOC)HUMS1005 Personalised English Language Enhancement (6 UOC)These courses, ARTS2050 and HUMS1005, can be counted as UNSW Arts and Social Sciences Prescribed Electives or Free Electives.General Education requirement for Internal Dual Mode programsBecause both Dual programs are internal to UNSW Arts and Social Sciences the General Education (GE) Exemption for dual programs does not apply.University MedalAn honours student in this program may be nominated for a University Medal in line with the University Medal Policy http://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/medalspolicy.pdf and Procedures http://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/medalsprocedure.pdf.TAFE Credit TransferStudents admitted to the Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) who have completed an approved TAFE diploma are eligible for credit transfer.

This requirement is met if an external major or minor (for example, Economics) is completed. Indigenous Studies courses (ATSIxxxx) can be studied as General Education only if students are not following a major or minor in Indigenous Studies within the BA program.University MedalAn honours student in this program may be nominated for a University Medal in line with the University Medal Policy http://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/medalspolicy.pdf and Procedures http://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/medalsprocedure.pdf.TAFE Credit TransferStudents admitted to the Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) who have completed an approved TAFE diploma are eligible for credit transfer. Slightly different credit transfers apply to students enrolled in dual degrees. For further information see https://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/disciplines/social-work/tafe-credit-transfer/.\nParticipation and Enrolment Requirements\nWorking with Children CheckThe Working With Children Check is valid for five years. It is a requirement for all students and is specifically designed for people who work or volunteer in child-related work. It involves a national criminal history check and a review of findings of workplace misconduct. The result of a Working With Children Check is either a clearance to work with children for five years, or a bar against working with children. Cleared applicants are subject to ongoing monitoring and relevant new records may lead to the clearance being revoked. The Working With Children Check is fully portable so it can be used for any paid or unpaid child-related work in NSW for as long as the worker remains cleared.You can apply for their Working With Children Check (WWCC) number on the NSW Office of the Children’s Guardian website. To be eligible for a WWCC you will have to show proof of identity to a NSW Motor Registry or Council Agency. For more information you may access the online tutorials and fact sheets at Working with Children Check.National Criminal Record CheckA National Criminal Record Check is valid for three years. You must undergo a National Criminal Record Check and provide an original copy of the Check results to the Work Integrated Learning Unit. The result of a Working With Children Check is either that there are ‘no disclosable outcomes’, or that there are ‘disclosable outcomes’ which are then detailed in the certificate. If you have a disclosable outcome(s) on your criminal record check you will need to undergo a risk assessment. Please contact the Work Integrated Learning Unit for further information about this.All placement students are subject to ongoing monitoring and must disclose new ‘disclosable outcomes’ to the Work Integrated Learning Unit. Some agencies (e.g NSW Health) only accept National Criminal Record Checks obtained through specific accredited agencies.Compliance with NSW Health Vaccination Requirements (NSW Health funded placements)In order to undertake placement in a NSW Health funded facility, you need to demonstrate evidence of protection against the following diseases:• Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough)• Hepatitis B• Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)• Varicella (chickenpox)• Tuberculosis (TB) - As specified on the Vaccination Card, this check is only required if you were born in a country with a high incidence of TB, or you have lived or travelled in a high risk TB country cumulatively for 3 months or more.Evidence of protection against these diseases must be recorded on the NSW Health vaccination card by a GP and serology reports must be provide for some diseases (reports from your doctor where protection is measured in your blood).Green P Drivers LicenceMany agencies require that students have a Green P Drivers Licence or above. Although it is not compulsory to have a NSW Drivers License to undertake placement, it is an essential requirement for social work tasks in most agencies. Not having a Green P or unrestricted Driver’s License will significantly limit student placement options.\nAcademic RulesDual ModeTo qualify for the award of the degree at Bachelor of Social Work (Honours) level, a student must:\n\nenrol in the Bachelor of Social Work and complete 168 UOC;\ncomplete the core requirements\ncomplete 6 UOC of General Education\n\nHonoursHonours will be awarded in the following classes, based on the student\'s WAM rounded to the nearest whole number:Honours Class I (selective WAM of 85 or higher)Honours Class II division 1, (selective WAM of 75-84)Honours Class II division 2 (selective WAM of 65-74)Honours Class III (selective WAM of 50-64)The award will be calculated on the basis of the WAM for Level 3 and 4 Program Core courses in Social Work, with the selected Honours course (SOCW4015 or SOCW4016) weighted as 24 units of credit to recognise integration of learning with professional practice in SOCW4014.The Weighted Average Mark (WAM) of Level 3 and 4 core courses in the Social Work (Honours) program are applied towards the award of the Honours Class. Therefore these courses cannot be undertaken in the Exchange Program as such courses completed are recorded as credit transfer without marks and cannot be included in the WAM calculation.Exit StrategiesStudents unable to meet the requirements of either SOCW3011 or SOCW4014 may exit the program and enrol in the Bachelor of Welfare Studies.

The profession of Civil Engineering was recognised by the formation of the Institution of Civil Engineers (UK) in 1825. In the 19th Century, the broadening scope of engineering led to the division of civilian engineering into civil, mechanical and electrical, with further specialisations (aeronautical, chemical, industrial, materials, electronic etc) having developed in the 20th Century.After contracting its sphere of interest over a long period of time, Civil Engineering is now broadening its scope with the recognition of the wider implications of its effects on modern society. Attention is given both to the interaction between civil engineering and other disciplines and to the effect of Civil Engineering works on the environment. Present day civil engineering has maintained strong commonality with military engineering - the design and construction of facilities such as roads, bridges, airfields, buildings, water supply and waste treatment facilities, structures of all types, and the associated planning and management of projects.A Civil Engineer in the ADF may be employed in the Royal Australian Engineers Corps of the Australian Army or as an Airfield Engineering Officer in the RAAF. The degree will provide graduates with professional engineering design, construction and management skills on a broad spectrum of engineering tasks required by the Australian Defence Force. Graduates will also develop enhanced planning and decision making skills and technical expertise to provide guidance to superiors and direction to subordinates, as required of Service officers.Except for Electrical Engineering and those in the Chief of Defence Force Honours Program first-year engineering and technology students enrol in a common program taking foundation science and engineering courses. In second and increasingly in third and fourth years the programs diverge into their specialities although there are some courses that span across programs in all years. A key element in all years is the design stream which emphasises complex problem solving. Other streams such as, structures, materials, hydraulics, environmental engineering, geotechnics and project management often incorporate project based learning informed by academic research and industrial practice. Electives and a final year thesis or integrated design enable students to pursue particular interests both within and outside the specialist discipline.At the end of the program students are expected to meet the graduate attributes of the University and stage 1 Competencies of Engineers Australia, ready to practice in their chosen profession and with the ingenuity and resourcefulness to meet rapid technological change.'),('4477','http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/about-us/our-campus/contacts','4 Years  ','192','The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Civil Engineering program has objectives and learning outcomes in common with the standard Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Civil Engineering program.

It became a separate branch of engineering in the early 1800s, when steam power began to be used in manufacture and transportation.One can identify four functions that are common to all branches of mechanical engineering.The first is the understanding of and dealing with the bases of mechanical science. These include dynamics, concerning the relationship between forces and motion, such as vibration; automatic control: thermodynamics, dealing with the relations among the various forms of heat, energy, and power; fluid flow; heat transfer; lubrication; and properties of materials.Second is the sequence of research, design, and development. This function attempts to bring about the changes necessary to meet present and future needs. Such work requires not only a clear understanding of mechanical science and an ability to analyse a complex system into its basic factors, but also the originality to synthesise and invent.Third is production of products and power, which embraces planning, operation and maintenance. The goal is to produce the maximum value with the minimum investment and cost while maintaining or enhancing longer term viability of the enterprise or the institution.Fourth is the co-ordinating function of the mechanical engineer, including management, consulting and, in some cases, marketing.In all of these functions there is a long continuing trend towards the use of scientific instead of traditional or intuitive methods. Operations research, value engineering and reliability centred maintenance are typical titles of such new rationalised approaches. Creativity, however, cannot be rationalised. The ability to take the important and unexpected step that opens up new solutions remains in mechanical engineering, as elsewhere, largely a personal and spontaneous characteristic.(The above description was adapted from the Encyclopedia Britannica).Army Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering graduates can expect to be posted to the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RAEME), Armour, or Infantry corps. Typically they will work in workshops, or headquarters or on equipment procurement in the Material Branch.Navy Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering graduates will undertake courses to enhance their professional development as Naval officers and Marine Engineers before taking up postings at sea or ashore.At the end of the program students are expected to meet the graduate attributes of the University and Stage 1 Competencies of Engineers Australia, ready to practise in their chosen profession and with the ingenuity and resourcefulness to meet rapid technological change.'),('4753','http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/','5 Years  ','240','Please refer to the program objectives and learning outcomes for the Bachelor of Media (Communication and Journalism) 3429'),('3429','mailto:sam@unsw.edu.au','3 Years  ','144','The Bachelor of Media (Communication and Journalism) [UNSW BMedia (C&J)] will provide you with foundational and applied skills, knowledge and capabilities in professional communication and journalism.
